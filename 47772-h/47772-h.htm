    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. MISTRESS AND MAID.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARY,&rdquo; said Lady
      Lisgard gravely, when her attendant had closed the door behind her, &ldquo;I
      want to have a little serious talk with you to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my Lady,&rdquo; returned Mistress Forest, in a tone which the
      other, did not fail to mark: it was a very respectful tone&mdash;a more
      humble one even than she was ordinarily wont to use&mdash;but there was a
      certain deliberation and set resolve about it too, which expressed as
      decidedly, as though she had used the words: &ldquo;I am ready to listen, madam;
      but I know very well what you are going to ask me, and I have made up my
      mind already to answer 'No.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; continued my Lady earnestly, but not without a tremor in her kind
      soft voice, &ldquo;come and sit here on the sofa beside me, and let us not be
      mistress and maid tonight, but only friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam;&rdquo; and Mary's voice trembled too, for this unlooked-for
      arrangement would place her, she knew, at a disadvantage in the argument
      which was certainly at hand. &ldquo;We have known one another many, many years,
      Mary&mdash;more than half our lives&mdash;and I don't think we have had a
      single quarrel yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one, ma'am, not one,&rdquo; assented the waiting-maid; already, after the
      manner of her susceptible kind, beginning to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can remember you when quite a child, Mary; not fifteen years old; as
      willing and kind-hearted a girl as the sun ever shone upon; and when I had
      not a friend in the world, nor even so much as a coin that I could call my
      own, and when I was weak and sick at heart, having lost all that was dear
      to me, I remember who it was that tended and caressed me as though I was
      her own sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ye, don't ye, my Lady; hush, hush!&rdquo; cried the weeping Mary. &ldquo;It was
      only natural that I should take to a sweet innocent creature cast at our
      very door by the raging sea. I often dream of that storm o' nights, madam,
      even now; of the thunder, and the lightning, and the rain; and of the
      flashes that were not lightning, but signals for help&mdash;that, alas! we
      could not give&mdash;from the poor doomed ship. And how father and the
      other fishermen, and many of the visitors themselves&mdash;and among them
      poor Sir Robert&mdash;all crowded down to the Cove, for they could not get
      nearer to the shore because of the waves; and I was with them, sheltering
      myself in the brushwood as well as I could, and peering through the
      branches to see the great white waves lit up for an instant, and then the
      darkness shutting all things out except the roaring of the storm. I mind
      it just as though it were but yesterday; and ah! my Lady, shall I ever
      forget when that one great wave dashed up into the very Cove itself,
      wetting us all to the skin, and knocking down young Jack West, whom it
      almost carried back with it in its return, and then the Great Black Spar,
      which it did carry back, with something white a-clinging to it; when my
      father cried out: 'O my God, a woman!' and all our hearts seemed stricken
      with a sudden shoot of pain. Lord! how I cried, for my part, to think that
      a poor creature should he tossing in that dreadful foam; and when I heard
      good Sir Robert's voice, clear and loud as a bugle: 'One hundred pounds to
      the man who brings her ashore, dead or alive!' I do believe I could have
      run out and kissed him. Ah, my Lady, what a noble gentleman he was; for
      though he could not have known how dear you were to be to him&mdash;you
      might have been an old woman, for all he could see&mdash;how he worked and
      strove to save you; not by his money alone, for no mère gain would have
      tempted men to do what was done that night, but by risking life and limb.
      They made a double chain, holding one another's hands, for there was no
      time to spare for ropes, and went down almost among the breakers, where
      you were: my father and Sir Robert were the two first men, God bless
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mistress Forest paused, interrupted by incipient hysterics, and my
      Lady herself cried like a child, but not in agony; her tears were tribute
      to the memory of a gallant deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mind my father had a black shoulder&mdash;a place you could not cover
      with both your hands&mdash;all along of the spar being driven up against
      him, but they carried it up with you upon it safe into the Cove, and then
      there was a great cry for us women to come down and help. Ah, how
      beautiful you looked, my Lady, though we thought you dead, white, and
      cold, and wet, with your long black hair dripping like sea-weed, and your
      tender limbs all bruised and bleeding. It must have been a kind band as
      tied you to the plank, for between your dainty waist and the rough rope
      there was bound a sailor's jacket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady moaned, and held her bands up as though she would say, &ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo;
       but Mistress Forest could not be stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was little enough clothes upon you, poor Lady, just a bodice and a
      petticoat, but round your neck there was hung a charm or two, and perhaps
      that had some hand in saying you from drowning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady looked quickly up; how strange it seemed that the comment passed
      by Mary Forest upon the locket (and the bundle of letters in their little
      waterproof case) should have been so exactly what Derrick had pointed out
      it would be. The coincidence reminded her of the task that lay before her,
      and of the danger of delaying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary, I indeed owe my life to you and yours, and I am not forgetful
      of the debt. Your welfare is, and ever will be only second in importance
      to that of my own children, and it is concerning it that I now wish to
      speak with you. Your future&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe me nothing, my dear Lady, that you have not paid again and again,
      I am sure,&rdquo; interrupted the waiting-maid hurriedly. &ldquo;When you rose to that
      high station, for which it seems to everybody you were born, your hand was
      always held out to me; through good report and evil report, you have ever
      stood my friend: it will be a great wrench of my heart, dearest mistress,
      when I leave your service&mdash;as I shall have to do, I fear, very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady. You see I'm not a young girl now; and it is not everybody
      who has so good a chance as I have now of&mdash;of&mdash;settling in life.
      Service is not inheritance, you know, my Lady, although I am well aware I
      should never want for nothing&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I live or die, Mary,&rdquo; broke in her mistress eagerly, &ldquo;I have
      taken care of that, good friend; and if I should die tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;
      But you shall see my will itself, for it lies here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand upon the desk before her, but Mary checked her with a
      determined &ldquo;No, my Lady; no. I was never greedy&mdash;with all my faults,
      you will grant that much, I know&mdash;and if I had been like Mrs Welsh,
      and others of this household I could name&mdash;but that I never was a
      mischief-maker&mdash;I might long since have put myself beyond all need of
      legacies, and you never would have missed it. But Mr Derrick is himself a
      person of property; a very rich man indeed for one in my condition of life&mdash;not
      that I need be a burden upon any man, thank Heaven, for I have money saved
      out of my wages&mdash;and very handsome they always were&mdash;and that
      great present of good Sir Robert's still untouched: the most generous of
      gentlemen he was. I am sure, my Lady, nobody felt for you as I did when
      Sir Robert died; and you have often said how terrible it was to lose a
      husband; therefore&rdquo;&mdash;here for a moment her excessive volubility
      flagged for the first time; she paused, and reddened, then added, with the
      air of a mathematician stating an indisputable corollary&mdash;&ldquo;therefore,
      you must allow, dear mistress, that to <i>find</i> one&mdash;particularly
      when one comes to my time of life&mdash;is not unpleasant, nor a chance to
      be lightly thrown aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends entirely upon the sort of husband he may be, Mary,&rdquo; observed
      my Lady gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, dear madam, with all respect, I think I am the best judge of
      that,&rdquo; rejoined the waiting-maid tartly; &ldquo;although, indeed, I never
      thought to say such words to you. Sir Richard may have his likes and
      dislikes, but I am not his slave; nor yet his servant, for the matter of
      that. While Master Walter, who, saving your presence, everybody knows to
      be worth a hundred of him, likes Ralph very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pang shot across my Lady's face, and left it crimson, as though she had
      received a blow; but the waiting-maid little knew what had brought the
      colour there, although she felt that she had pained her mistress deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me,&rdquo; cried she penitently, &ldquo;if my foolish tongue has hurt
      your feelings, my Lady! I did not mean to say aught against Sir Richard, I
      am sure. I scarcely knew what I said, for when those are dear to us&mdash;as
      Ralph has grown to be with me, and I don't deny it&mdash;are misjudged and
      wronged, why, then, we are apt to say bitter things. This talk was none of
      my seeking, my Lady; and although Ralph thinks that you are to blame
      because of his being forbidden the Hall, and all the rest of it, I have
      always told him you have never said a word to set me against him; and oh,
      I am sorry you are doing it now, because what is done cannot be undone,
      and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven! you are not married to this man?&rdquo; cried my Lady, rising
      from her seat with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, my Lady&mdash;certainly not, my Lady,&rdquo; rejoined the waiting-maid
      with a certain demure dignity. &ldquo;There has been nothing underhand between
      us in the matter at all, except, that is, so far as meeting Mr Derrick at
      the back gate&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go out to meet him <i>to-night?</i>&rdquo; inquired Lady Lisgard
      sharply, and keeping her eyes fixed steadily upon her attendant's face.
      &ldquo;No, madam, I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is speaking truth,&rdquo; murmured my Lady to herself. &ldquo;Who, then, could it
      be whom I saw upon the churchyard path just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; continued Mrs Forest quietly, &ldquo;I don't deny that I have often
      met him after dusk, no other time being permitted to us; but to-day he has
      gone to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are to write to him thither to give him your final decision as to
      whether you will become his wife or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth do you know that, my Lady?&rdquo; inquired the waiting-maid with a
      curiosity even beyond her indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> know it, dear old friend,&rdquo; answered Lady Lisgard tenderly,
      &ldquo;and it is because of that knowledge that I have sent for you to-night, to
      strive to persuade you to write 'No,' while there is yet time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very seldom&mdash;not once in a year, perhaps&mdash;that Mary
      Forest was ever out of temper with my Lady; but then such a supreme
      occasion as the present had never occurred before. Underneath their mère
      superficial relation of mistress and servant, they were more like elder
      and younger sister; but then even sisters quarrel when the one wants the
      other&mdash;generally under some pretence of mère prudence, not to be
      listened to by a woman of spirit&mdash;to give up the man of her choice.
      The ample countenance of Mistress Forest expressed something more than
      Decision in the negative; there was an unpleasant smile upon her pale
      lips, which seemed to say: &ldquo;If you knew what I know, you would know that
      you are wasting your breath.&rdquo; She sat with her plump hands folded before
      her, like a naughty boy that has been put in the corner, but who does not
      care&mdash;nay, more, who knows that he has got a cracker to put presently
      under his master's chair, the results of which will make full amends for
      the inconvenience he at present experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say nothing more, Mary, of the mutual esteem and affection between
      us two, and of the pain that an eternal parting&mdash;such as your
      marriage with this Mr Derrick would most undoubtedly entail&mdash;needs
      must cost us both. I presume that you have weighed that matter in your
      mind, and found it&mdash;however weighty&mdash;insufficient to alter your
      determination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded, sharply enough, but it was doubtful if she could have spoken.
      Already her features had lost their rigidity, as though melted by my
      Lady's touching tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known this person&mdash;that is to say, you have met him some
      dozen times&mdash;during a period of less than four months; yet such is
      his influence over you, that you are prepared to sacrifice for him a
      friend of thirty years' standing, a comfortable home, and a position in
      which you are respected by all who know you. If I was speaking to a young
      girl, Mary, I should not advance these arguments; but you are a&mdash;a
      wise and sensible woman, and yet not of such a mature age that you need
      despair of finding a suitable partner for the rest of your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Forest heaved a little sigh of relief, and her cheeks began to
      tone down to something like their natural crimson; they <i>had</i> been
      purple with the apprehension of what my Lady might have said upon the
      subject of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what is it,&rdquo; pursued my Lady, &ldquo;which has produced this confidence in
      an almost entire stranger? Do you know anything of his former life, which
      may be a guarantee to you for the stability of your future? Have you ever
      met a single individual who is acquainted with it in any way? For all you
      know, this man may have been a&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, the relative position of Mentor and pupil were exchanged;
      there was a quiet power about the waiting-maid's rebuke, for which an
      archbishop would have given more than his blessing, if he could only have
      incorporated it into a &ldquo;charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mary,&rdquo; said my Lady frankly; &ldquo;let us only speak of what is
      within our own knowledge. Does this man's own conduct, then, give any
      promise of lasting happiness to the woman who may become his wife? Is he
      sober?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is fond of a glass, my Lady, as most men are who have no
      home, or people to look after them. If he had a wife, he would never go to
      the public-house at all, perhaps&mdash;he tells me so himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he industrious and provident, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has earned his money hardly enough, my Lady, and it seems only natural
      that he should now spend a little in enjoying himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not fling his money to left and right&mdash;I use your own words,
      dear Mary&mdash;and treat every chance-companion he comes across to
      liquor. Do you suppose that at his age he is likely to change habits of
      this sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not aware, my Lady, that his age is anything against him,&rdquo; replied
      the waiting-maid coldly. &ldquo;He is not so like to run through his money as if
      he were younger, and particularly when he has got some one to provide for
      beside himself. And indeed, so far as money goes, he has thousands of
      pounds; and if all goes well with him&mdash;and something has occurred
      to-day about which he has sent me a line by hand, dear fellow, by which it
      has been made almost certain that things <i>will</i> go well&mdash;he will
      be a very rich man indeed after a week or two. There is some great race on
      Epsom Downs&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mary, how can you talk so cheerfully of money acquired in that way. If
      it is won to-day, it is lost to-morrow; and even if it were not so, do you
      know that it is gained from those who can ill afford to lose it, and who,
      having lost it, often turn to wicked ways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that, my Lady, I'm sure,&rdquo; responded the waiting-maid
      demurely; &ldquo;I leave all these things to my betters. But, I suppose, if
      racing was a crime, Mr Chifney would not be let to have the Abbey Barn&mdash;Sir
      Richard being so very particular&mdash;and Master Walter would not for
      ever be up at the stables. Why, he and Mr Derrick are both together, hand
      and glove, in this very business&mdash;something about a French racer, it
      is; although, when you and I were at Dijon, my Lady, we never heard of
      there being such a thing in all France, did we?&mdash;so my poor Ralph
      cannot be so very wicked after all. And please, ma'am, it is no use saying
      anything more about it, for I have written him that letter already which
      he was to find in London, and put it in the post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you answer 'Yes,' or 'No,' Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered 'Yes,' my Lady&mdash;that I would marry him&mdash;and begging
      your pardon, madam, but I mean to stand to it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. CONFESSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE is one
      serious disadvantage&mdash;which mistresses should do well to remember&mdash;at
      which waiting-maids are always placed in disputations with their domestic
      superiors; they cannot (except they are prepared for instant dismissal)
      either quit the room, and hang the door after them, or leave it open, and
      run down stairs &ldquo;saying things&rdquo; at the top of their voices. Both these
      modes of procedure, so natural to the female when &ldquo;put out,&rdquo; are denied to
      them, for the same reason that when on board ship they can't take
      champagne for sea-sickness as their employers do; they cannot afford the
      indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although Mary Forest was not debarred by mère pecuniary
      considerations from flinging herself out of her mistress's room when she
      cried, &ldquo;And I mean to stand to it,&rdquo; there were other reasons which
      prevented her from suiting to her words that very appropriate and natural
      action. In all her blinding passion (and she was really very angry), she
      never quite lost sight of the respect she owed her mistress. Her devotion
      to her was such, that even while she listened to her most unpalatable
      arguments against the man she had accepted for her husband, her heart
      smote her with a sense of ingratitude towards the long-tried friend, who,
      after all, she knew, was anxious for her happiness rather than for her own
      mère comfort; and when she seemed most obstinate, she had often been
      nearest to throwing herself upon her mistress's neck, and exclaiming: &ldquo;You
      are quite right, my Lady; and I believe I have been an old fool all
      along.&rdquo; It was more with the desire of putting a stop to this most
      unpleasant dispute, than because her determination was absolutely
      adamantine and inflexible, that she once more reiterated: &ldquo;Yes, my Lady, I
      mean to stand to it,&rdquo; and fixed her eyes doggedly upon the floor, as
      though she would not even encounter another questioning glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said her mistress solemnly, and after a long silence, &ldquo;I am
      grieved beyond all power of words to tell at what you have just said; but
      the mischief may not yet be quite past mending. I have seen this&mdash;Mr
      Derrick&mdash;this very night, and therefore he will not receive your
      letter till, at earliest, to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor then neither, my Lady, so far as that goes, for I was late for
      the London post; I put the letter in the box for the very reason that I
      might not be persuaded to change my mind by&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it has not yet left the village postoffice,&rdquo; interrupted my Lady,
      hastily snatching up her bonnet from the table on which she had wearily
      put it down upon entering the room: &ldquo;there is time to stop it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lady; I heard the postman's horn half an hour ago; and if it were
      otherwise, nothing would induce me to alter what I have already written&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
       repeated Mistress Forest, emphasising her last two words by beating with
      her foot upon the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, dear friend, you know not what you say,&rdquo; replied my Lady very
      gravely. &ldquo;Give me your hand, Mary; nay, do not withdraw it coldly, for you
      will have need of comfort and support, almost as much, alas, as I&mdash;&mdash;<i>Mary,
      Mary, this man is married already!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiting-maid started from her seat with a shrill scream. &ldquo;I don't
      believe it, I won't believe it; it is false. How dare you tell a lie to
      me, Lady Lisgard, only to gain your ends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Mary; did you ever know me to tell a lie, my friend? It is
      true as that yonder moon is rising, that this man has a wife alive. Do not
      weep so passionately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The perjured villain; the false, bad man; the wicked, wicked wretch!&rdquo;
       cried the waiting-maid, her eyes flashing through their tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, above all, do not blame <i>him</i>, Mary, for he knows it not
      himself; he does not, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Not know whether he's married or not!&rdquo; sobbed the unhappy
      bride-elect. &ldquo;I don't believe that, at all events, even if I believe you.
      He has married so many, he doesn't know rightly who is his wife; that is
      what you mean, I see. Sailors are all alike. O dear, dear, dear, when Mrs
      Welsh comes to know of it! And the monster will have got my letter by
      to-morrow night, to shew about! How nearly have I been committing bi&mdash;bi&mdash;bigamy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, dear Mary, calm yourself. Your trouble is nothing to what
      I suffer, and must continue to endure for my life long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my Lady, I daresay it is very bad to be a widow; but it's much worse
      to die an old&mdash;&mdash;leastways, at forty-fi&mdash;or forty-four,
      rather&mdash;to lose&mdash;&mdash; O dear! what an honest man he looked,
      and such a beard and eyes! I will never trust to appearances again. I
      daresay, it is very wrong, my Lady, but I fee&mdash;fee&mdash;feel as
      though I could tear Mrs Derrick's eyes out; I do, indeed.&rdquo; Here the bottle
      of smelling-salts, which upon a certain occasion we saw used by Mary
      Forest for the recovery of her mistress, had to change hands. The
      unfortunate waiting-maid was taken with a very genuine fit of hysterics,
      and not of the quiet sort either; and if her senses left her, it could not
      certainly be said that she also lost the use of her limbs. At last,
      exhausted in body, but also more reasonable as to her mind, she whispered:
      &ldquo;Mistress, dearest, tell me all you know.&rdquo; Then my Lady knew that the time
      was come for her first self-humiliation. Throughout the narrative that
      followed, they were sitting upon the sofa together, hand in hand, but each
      had her face averted from the other, and only now and then, by a
      convulsive grasp of the fingers, did Mary shew her sympathy with her
      unhappy mistress. At first, she was too full of her own trouble to
      interrupt by words, but soon the astounding revelation from my Lady's lips
      overwhelmed every faculty of speech within her, and she sat like a child
      who listens to a horrid story in the darkening twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have known one another more than half our lives, Mary, said I, a while
      ago, and yet there has been a secret between us all that time. I have
      never kept anything else from you, but this was not mine alone to tell; it
      was Sir Robert's also. When he asked me to become his wife at Coveton, and
      you thought me so mad for first refusing him, and afterwards for demanding
      such a long delay, I had a reason for it, which he knew, but which you
      have never guessed. I was then the three-weeks' bride of another man.&mdash;You
      may well start, Mary, but that is the dreadful truth. The man, Ralph
      Gavestone, whom I mourned so deeply, as being drowned with my dear
      parents, and all the rest of the ship's company, in that great storm&mdash;which
      I would to Heaven had whelmed me in its waves&mdash;was not my
      half-brother, as Sir Robert persuaded me to give out, but my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no wedding-ring, my Lady, when you came ashore,&rdquo; murmured the
      waiting-maid half incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Mary. I know not how it was, but perhaps the cold and wet
      of that dreadful night made my fingers shrink&mdash;you remember how wan
      and thin I looked&mdash;and the ring must have dropped off; I never saw it
      after I reached land. But I was none the less a widow&mdash;as I thought;
      and although friendless, save for you, Mary&mdash;homeless and penniless,
      I thought I could never take another husband to my arms, although the
      raging sea had worked that rough divorce between us. At first, I replied:
      'No, Sir Robert, never;' you will bear me witness that I did. Then, when
      he pressed me still, I bargained for three years. I thought that he would
      tire of waiting for me, and get some fitter mate in the meantime; I did,
      as Heaven is my judge. I was true to my poor Ralph&mdash;he had saved me
      upon that spar at the risk, and, as I then believed, at the sacrifice of
      his own life&mdash;as long as I&mdash;nay, I was true to him in a sense
      for ever. Sir Robert was well aware of that. I do not need justification
      from man or woman; God himself absolved me, I think, so far. But that was
      an evil day, Mary, when I married. I was no more Sir Robert's wife than
      you were, Mary. Think of that. And he was not my husband. And our
      children, of whom he was so proud, are baseborn&mdash;bastards. Sir
      Richard&mdash;is it not terrible? do you not wonder that I live and am not
      mad?&mdash;he is not Sir Richard. And my dear, dear Walter, he is baseborn
      too. And Letty&mdash;for whom her eldest brother thinks nobody too high&mdash;she,
      too, is no Lisgard. If I had waited seven years instead of three, this
      would not have been so. There are law-books in the library which have told
      me so much; but I have no adviser&mdash;none; no friend&mdash;yes, you,
      Mary, I know&mdash;but not one who can help me. Is not this something
      worse than death itself which has fallen upon me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this man Derrick&mdash;he was Gavestone?&rdquo; whispered Mary Forest in a
      hoarse grating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; did I not tell you so? I only found it out last Christmas Eve. I
      knew his voice, and I knew the carol that he sang. For one thing only do I
      thank Heaven&mdash;I who had reason, as I thought, to be thankful for so
      many things&mdash;that Sir Robert is not alive. His sleep in yonder
      churchyard is disturbed by no such ghastly dream. Ah, happy dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistress, beloved mistress,&rdquo; cried the waiting-maid, in an agony of
      remorse&mdash;&ldquo;forgive me that I have been thinking of myself these many
      weeks, while you have been so burdened and tormented. Henceforth, I am
      yours only. As I hope to get to heaven when I die, I will be true to you
      whatever happens. Let us think what that may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let us <i>not</i> think,&rdquo; exclaimed her mistress with a shudder, &ldquo;or
      I shall lose my wits. 'Would you have me picture what this house would be
      should <i>he</i> come hither and claim me for his wife? Richard and he
      beneath the self-same roof, and he the master! Would Walter&mdash;though
      he herds with him, you say&mdash;brook this man as his equal? Would he not
      loathe him rather, and how soon, ah me! unlearn the love he owes to me&mdash;his
      wretched mother! I cannot hear to think of it, I tell you. Let us act; let
      us be doing something&mdash;something! How my brain whirls! Think for me,
      Mary&mdash;pray for me, for Heaven is deaf, alas, to my poor prayers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even while she spoke, the gracious tears began to fill the furrows in
      her cheeks, which until now had been dry throughout her talk; and having
      told her friend, the weight about her heart was lifted off a little, and
      the tightness round her brow was loosened by the blessed hand of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must write to him at once,&rdquo; said Mary thoughtfully. &ldquo;How fortunate that
      he did not leave Mirk until to-night. The two letters will now reach him
      at the same time. He cannot write in answer to the one which&mdash;which I
      wrote first&mdash;without having read the other; that will be something
      saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but little hope in that, I fear; for he himself has this night
      told me&mdash;yes, I saw him face to face, Mary, only I was thickly
      veiled, thank Heaven&mdash;he told me frankly (thinking I did not wish to
      lose my waiting-maid) that he should lay it to my charge if your reply was
      'No,' and should not take it as the answer of your heart. How much more,
      if he gets a refusal coming so quickly upon the very heels of this
      acceptance, will he decline to believe it comes from your own self. More
      likely, it would cause him, reckless as he is, to do something rash and
      vengeful&mdash;perhaps to return hither on the instant, and&mdash;&mdash;
      O Mary, Mary, I would give five thousand pounds this day, if that would
      stop his coming to Mirk again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that <i>not</i> stop him, mistress?&rdquo; asked the waiting-maid with
      earnest gravity. &ldquo;Five thousand pounds is a fortune, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not stop <i>him</i>, Mary,&rdquo; rejoined my Lady sadly. &ldquo;Ralph
      Gavestone, even in his youth-time, never valued money a fillip when
      weighed against a whim; and now his will is more a law to him than ever. I
      have never known Resolve so fixed as I read it in his eyes this night. And
      if he guessed the truth, Mary&mdash;oh, if he did but dream that I, his
      lawful wife, for whom he had gladly laid his own life down, whose memory
      he has kept fresh and green when all else has withered, whose loss has
      been his ruin, was playing him false!&mdash;he said himself, that on his
      reckless soul 'twas like as not there might be murder some day&mdash;and,
      Mary, I do believe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      White as the very moonbeams was my Lady's face, and the hand trembled
      which held the handkerchief she passed across her damp white brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for myself, good Mary, is this fear,&rdquo; gasped she, &ldquo;but for my dear
      ones&mdash;do you hear them yonder? is it not sad to listen to such mirth?&mdash;for
      this unhappy man being wronged, becomes a madman straightway. Not disgrace
      alone may fall upon us here, not only shame&mdash;think of that, Mary; not
      <i>only</i> shame upon Sir Richard and the rest! but even Crime may visit
      us. This house of dead Sir Robert&mdash;once the home of peace, and genial
      ease, and hospitality&mdash;&mdash;But that shall never be; no, they shall
      never meet, my sons and he; I will die rather, and my corpse would part
      them wide enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mistress, talk not so; you freeze my very blood. What was it we were
      saying before you began to look like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talked of bribing this Ralph Gavestone&mdash;for how could I offer
      him gold save <i>as</i> a bribe! But if a bribe, what need was there to
      bribe him? Why should I wish him once more upon the other side of the
      world? Why pay him a younger brother's portion, to quit the courtship of
      my waiting-maid? No, Mary, this man is no mère rogue, that he should take
      his money without question, and be off; he is suspicious, keen&mdash;and
      ah, if wronged, as implacable as Death itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, my Lady!&rdquo; cried Mistress Forest leaping to her feet. &ldquo;I do
      believe I have a plan to get that letter back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good Heaven! What is it, wise, kind heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, madam,&rdquo; and she began to reckon on her plump fingers, with her
      pleasant face aglow with mingled joy and astonishment at her own sagacity:
      &ldquo;the note was put in late for the London post from Dalwynch; it will
      therefore remain there, though it has left Mirk, all to-night, and not be
      forwarded till the morning mail. If we drive over to-morrow early&mdash;starting,
      say, at six o'clock&mdash;we shall be in plenty of time to stop its going
      further. In the meantime, I will write another letter in its place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved me&mdash;for this time&mdash;I do believe, dear Mary; yes,
      we can drive to Dalwynch&mdash;I will give orders for the carriage to be
      ready at six&mdash;and still be back at the Abbey by breakfast-time. If we
      are pressed for the reason, we can give the true one&mdash;to a certain
      point, if needs must be&mdash;you had a mind to alter what you have
      written to your suitor.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III. CONTRARY TO THE REGULATIONS OF HER MAJESTY'S POST-OFFICE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ORELY did the fat
      coachman, who had no neck, inveigh against that caprice of his mistress
      which compelled his appearance at the front door upon the ensuing morning
      at an hour so altogether unexampled. If he had but heard that it was all
      upon the account of Mistress Forest, and the outlandish fellow who wore
      little gold rings in his ears, and that curly heard, so like the door-mat
      of the servants-hall, it is doubtful whether he would have obeyed such a
      premature behest at all; but as it was, he was sitting on the coach-box
      with the sleek nags before him, at the foot of the great steps which led
      down from the entrance-hall, at six o'clock to a minute. It was broad
      daylight of course, so bright that it made him wink again, as it flashed
      upon the glittering harness and the shining skins of the pampered beasts;
      but still it was not a time for a man of his years and girth to be hurried
      up and made to toil. &ldquo;As late as you please at night, my Lady, and nobody
      ever heard Joe Wiggins utter a murmur,&rdquo; muttered he; &ldquo;but there's no
      constitushun as can stand such wear and tear as <i>this</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However that might be with Mr Wiggins, Miss Rose Aynton seemed to make
      uncommonly light of early rising, for, much to the astonishment of her
      hostess, she was up and dressed and in the breakfast-room when that lady
      made her appearance at half-past five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to hear that you were going-out betimes, dear Lady Lisgard,&rdquo;
       said she with her sweetest smile; &ldquo;and getting up in these first summer
      mornings is <i>such</i> a treat to a poor London-bred girl like me; so,
      without saying a word to dearest Letty, I thought I would just fill her
      place for once, and make your coffee for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Rose,&rdquo; returned my Lady a little stiffly, for she had not
      intended that anybody, and far less one who was not a member of her own
      family, should have been a witness to her departure. &ldquo;I have unpleasant
      business on hand which takes me to Dalwynch before the morning train
      starts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to London,&rdquo; began Rose hesitatingly, as if intending to
      send something by my Lady's hands to her aunt, &ldquo;if it was not too much
      trouble&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;I am not going to London,&rdquo; replied Lady Lisgard
      quietly. &ldquo;I shall be back by the usual breakfast-hour, I have no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here my Lady sipped her coffee with the air of a connoisseur, and
      perceiving Miss Aynton was about to ask more questions, requested a little
      sugar; then a fresh supply of&mdash;no, not hot milk&mdash;some cream.
      Would the carriage never come round, and release her from this importunate
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad the people will be to see you about again once more, Lady
      Lisgard,&rdquo; observed Miss Aynton cheerfully. &ldquo;You can't imagine how curious
      they have been to know why you have shut yourself up so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware that my movements were any business of theirs, Rose,&rdquo;
       returned my Lady with severity, &ldquo;nor, indeed, of anybody's except myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; answered Miss Aynton carelessly; &ldquo;that is what I always told
      them. Besides, it is not pleasant to run the chance of meeting a rude and
      perhaps half-drunken ruffian like this man Derrick, when one knows he has
      made up his mind to address one upon the first opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said my Lady scornfully, &ldquo;I assure you I was quite unaware of
      that dreadful menace.&rdquo; She stole a glance over her cup, to see if there
      was anything to read in this strange girl's face; but there was nothing.
      As soon as she had finished her duties in connection with the coffeepot,
      she had taken a piece of fancy-work in her hands, in the execution of
      which she seemed entirely wrapped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes; of course it is most ridiculous, but that is what all the village
      has been saying for these five months, more or less; and now that you are
      going out for the first time, when he has but left the place overnight,
      they are sure to say&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, Rose, that this man left Mirk last night?&rdquo; inquired my
      Lady, setting down her cup, and looking at the young girl fixedly. Could
      it possibly have been <i>she</i> whom she had beheld lurking about the
      churchyard wall, and perhaps listening to the conversation, in the course
      of which Derrick had announced his intention of going at that late hour to
      Dalwynch, so as to be in time for the first up-train upon the morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush stole over Miss Aynton's face, but by no means such a blush
      as is called &ldquo;tell-tale:&rdquo; it might easily enough have been caused by the
      mère directness of the question. &ldquo;Your son, Mr Walter, told me,&rdquo; replied
      she simply&mdash;&ldquo;he is a great ally of this man's, you know.&mdash;Here
      is the carriage. I am afraid you will find it very dull, Lady Lisgard,
      taking this long drive all alone. If I thought that my company&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Rose,&rdquo; replied my Lady hastily; &ldquo;it is most kind of you to
      offer it; but the fact is, I am going to take Forest with me. This visit
      to Dalwynch is mainly upon her account indeed. If the chariot held more
      than two, perhaps I should take you at your word; but as it is&mdash;&mdash;See,
      I have a book for my companion.&mdash;Come, Forest; we have no time to
      lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had entered the room while she was speaking, and gave quite a start
      at seeing Miss Aynton at the breakfast-table. Her mistress was already
      cloaked, and had her bonnet on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Dalwynch, my Lady?&rdquo; said the footman, having put up the steps and
      closed the chariot-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; drive fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which part of the town, my Lady?&rdquo; for there were two roads to the
      post-town, the relative length of which from the Abbey depended upon what
      part of the place was to be visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aynton was standing on the last flight of the stone steps, and could
      hear every word that was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the lower road,&rdquo; replied my Lady very distinctly; and the well-hung
      chariot&mdash;pleasantest invention save the fair-weather Hansom, which
      the wit of coachmakers has yet sought out&mdash;rolled swiftly along the
      gravelled road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are not going to the railway station,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss,&rdquo; assented the butler, as he stood at the open hall-door,
      regarding nature as though it were a novelty to him at that hour. &ldquo;I
      should say it must be the postoffice. Perhaps my Lady wishes to get the
      letters this morning earlier than the Mirk's man can bring them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, Roberts,&rdquo; returned the young lady, a little disconcerted at
      her involuntary remark having been overheard. &ldquo;Let us hope she will have
      good news. But I should scarcely have thought it was necessary to have
      gone herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am not so sure, miss. Mrs Rudd, the post-mistress at Dalwynch, is
      a great stickler for forms and that, and she might have made some
      difficulty, particularly as she did not obtain her place through our
      influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Whose</i> influence, Roberts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours, miss, to be sure. The Lisgard interest, you see, was given last
      election to the losing side. Although time was, I can well recollect, when
      poor Sir Robert had everything of that sort at his disposal that was
      vacant in these parts; but them yallers, they have gone and spoilt it all
      this time.&rdquo; And with a sigh of regret for the golden age of patronage, and
      a shake of the head directed against the levelling opinions at present in
      the ascendant, Mr Roberts went off to his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the wheels of the chariot began to move, than Lady Lisgard
      observed to her companion: &ldquo;You have the letter with you that I dictated
      last night, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady; here it is, though not sealed down, in case you might have
      thought of anything to add.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mary,&rdquo; said her mistress, perusing it; &ldquo;there is nothing here that I
      can better by thought, although I spent all night in thinking over it. A
      refusal could scarce be made shorter or more decided than this; there is
      not a trace of vacillation to give the most sanguine suitor hope.&rdquo; Then,
      as if some other idea was expressing itself almost in spite of herself,
      she added: &ldquo;Do I not look deadly pale, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very white and worn, madam, as you well may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But bad enough for people to observe who did not know the cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some people, madam. <i>She</i> saw it sharp enough, if you mean <i>her</i>,
      my Lady,&rdquo; and the waiting-maid made a significant gesture in the direction
      of Miss Rose Aynton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing escapes <i>her</i>, bless you&mdash;nothing; and the sooner she's
      out of the house, under present circumstances&mdash;and indeed under every
      circumstance, in my opinion&mdash;the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never liked her from the first, Mary,&rdquo; said her mistress in the tone
      of one who argues against her own conviction. &ldquo;We should not be
      uncharitable in our judgments of others, and particularly as respects
      young folks; we often set down as serious faults what in them is only
      thoughtlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Aynton is none of that sort, my Lady; she always thinks before she
      speaks, and takes a good long look before she leaps; and for all she seems
      as though butter would not melt in her mouth, she's as full o' schemes as
      a cat at a dairy-door. If there's cream to be got in this world, she'll
      get it, my Lady, I'll go bail, let the butter-milk fall to whose share it
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that I can't quite understand her,&rdquo; said my Lady musing. &ldquo;I am
      sure, when she first came, she seemed simple and unobtrusive enough;
      while, on the other hand, in her manner towards me of late&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downright impudence, I call it, my Lady, in such a chit as she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't say that; but she is certainly not so respectful as she
      might be. I shall be sorry to send her back to London just as the summer
      is beginning, to live with her cross old aunt, whom she appears to dislike
      so; but I confess I think she has been here long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too long, my Lady, much too long,&rdquo; answered Mrs Forest gravely; &ldquo;she
      has set more people in the house by the ears than you wot of. While Anne
      Rees, who used to be Miss Letty's maid, one would think Miss Aynton was
      her mistress now, so entirely has she got her under her thumb. She has
      ferreted out some folly of Anne's&mdash;Heaven knows how she did it, or
      what it is; but the girl's her slave. From whom but her did she learn that
      you were starting at this hour? And, again, why was not Miss Letty told as
      well as Miss Rose? Do you suppose she would have let anybody else make
      coffee for her mamma, if she had been aware of your departure? No, no.
      Then Miss Aynton will take credit to herself for not permitting Miss Letty
      to be called, and fatigue herself by getting up so early. Nasty, sly young
      hussy! That's just her way; uncommon civil, kind, and attentive until she
      gets the upper hand, and finds you under her thumb; then you begin to know
      her. We've found her out in the servants-hall, although she makes a fool
      of old Roberts yet. She actually told him, that at the last dinner-party
      at the Abbey she thought him the most distinguished-looking person in the
      room; but only wait till she catches him some afternoon at the Madeira!
      then he'll be her obedient, humble servant, without having any more pretty
      speeches. That's a bad, bold girl, ma'am, let her be ten times a lady
      born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mistress Forest, indignantly tossing her head back, without making
      due allowance for her bonnet, came into sharp contact with the back of the
      chariot, and severely bit her tongue. My Lady was thereby enabled to
      interpose a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why have you not told me a word of this before, Mary? I would never
      have permitted a guest of mine, and particularly a young lady to whom I
      stand in the relation of guardian while she is under my roof, first to
      ingratiate herself with my servants, and then to tyrannise over them in
      the way you describe. I never heard of anything more atrociously mean, and
      I think you have been wanting in your duty&mdash;let alone your personal
      regard for me, Mary&mdash;to have concealed the matter so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, my Lady, you have nobody to blame but yourself for
      that,&rdquo; observed the waiting-maid with asperity. &ldquo;The only harsh words you
      ever spoke to me were about certain of Mrs Welsh's doings, of which I
      complained with reason, though I do not wish to refer to them now. What
      you said was this: 'Never abuse the affectionate relation in which we two
      stand, Mary, by causing me to side with you against your fellow-servants.
      I can deny you nothing, but do not vex me with talebearing. I hate all
      vulgar gossip, and despise those who bring it.' After a setting-down like
      that, it was not likely that I should give tongue about Miss Aynton's
      ways, nor let you know how she has made Anne Rees a spy upon us all. No,
      no; mind your own business, Mary Forest, says you; and I've minded it, my
      Lady, ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be angry with me, friend,&rdquo; returned Lady Lisgard sadly; &ldquo;I daresay
      I was wrong; and even if not, I have no heart to argue with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no wonder, poor dear,&rdquo; assented the waiting-maid, greatly mollified.
      &ldquo;I was a brute to bring it up against you just now in all this trouble;
      nor was it the right time, perhaps, to speak about Miss Aynton's goings
      on. Only you yourself said her manner was not quite what it used to be,
      and I was so afraid that she might be getting <i>you</i>, my Lady, under
      her thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could that possibly be, Mary? She surely cannot have the slightest
      suspicion of&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sniffs something, my Lady, or she would not have been making your
      coffee this morning. However, let her sniff, only be you very careful to
      lock your desk; and when you want to say anything to me about you know
      who, come out of earshot of the keyhole of your own door.&mdash;Ah,
      wouldn't she, though? But I know better. A thief? No, I didn't say a
      thief, although, for the matter of that, she has a mind to steal from you,
      or I am much mistaken, something you value most on earth&mdash;your son.
      There now, I've said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the waiting-maid drew a very long breath, as though some oppressive
      weight was off her mind at last. She evidently expected her mistress to
      express astonishment, if not horror; and it was positively a
      disappointment to her when my Lady replied calmly: &ldquo;I know all about that,
      Mary; but you are doing Miss Aynton wrong. She might have been my
      daughter-in-law if she liked, and yet, to my certain knowledge, she
      refused to be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>refused?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly she did. My son made her an offer in my presence, and she
      rejected him.&mdash;But here we are at Dalwynch. Tell Wiggins to stop at
      the post-office. Thank Heaven, there is plenty of time to spare. How my
      heart does beat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiting-maid pulled the check-string, and delivered her mistress's
      orders, but quite mechanically, without knowing what she said. In spite of
      the importance of what she had now so immediately to do, her mind was
      entirely occupied with the wonder of what she had just heard, and she kept
      repeating to herself: &ldquo;And she rejected him? and she rejected him?&rdquo; while
      her heightened eyebrows almost amalgamated with her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps some of this excessive astonishment was due to poor Mistress
      Forest's peculiar position; she thought it so strange that one of her own
      sex should reject any man&mdash;who was not already married to somebody
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the post-office, Mary. Mind you speak very civilly to the woman,
      and make haste; I shall be in a perfect fever till I see you come back
      with that dreadful letter safe in your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One minute, two minutes, three minutes&mdash;each seeming an hour to my
      Lady, shrinking in a corner of the chariot, while the omnibus to the
      station passed and repassed, picking up she knew not what passengers, and
      bearing Derrick himself, for all she knew, within it. At last Lady Lisgard
      could endure the suspense no longer. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said she to the footman
      standing beside the door, &ldquo;what is Forest about? Why does she not return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is talking to Mrs Rudd, my Lady. I think there is some dispute about
      a letter; for they are both in the post-office department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me out, John,&rdquo; exclaimed my Lady impatiently; and the next instant
      she had entered Mrs Rudd's establishment. This was, for the most part, a
      grocer's shop; one-fifth of it only being reserved for the reception and
      despatch of Her Majesty's mails. There were no customers at that still
      early hour; a young man who was sanding the floor with some ostentation,
      as though to imply that <i>all</i> the sand went that way, and none into
      the sugar, made a respectable pause as my Lady's silk swept by; and
      another, who appeared to be washing his hands in tea, assumed that sickly
      smile which is supposed by persons of his class to conciliate people of
      quality; but Mrs Rudd herself, intrenched behind her little post-office
      palisade, gave no sign of gracious welcome, and from out the pigeon-hole
      through which she distributed her stamps, her words poured forth in an
      undiminished stream of denial and severity; nay, I doubt whether the
      presence of my Lady did not intensify the bitterness of its tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever importance it may be to you to get this letter, Mistress
      Forest,&rdquo; cried she, addressing poor Mary, who was looking very
      disconsolate, and not a little angry also, &ldquo;it is of much greater moment
      to me that I should keep it. It is as much as my place is worth to give a
      letter back which has once been given into my charge; and I am not aware
      that I owe that place to my Lady Lisgard, and therefore feel called upon
      to risk&mdash;&mdash;I beg pardon, your Ladyship&mdash;but I did not catch
      sight of you before. What your servant has come to ask of me is something
      out of the question. I will post this second letter for her&mdash;although
      it is two minutes past the time, even with an extra stamp, for <i>that</i>&mdash;but
      as for returning her this other: yes, I have no doubt it's hers&mdash;although,
      for that matter, people's handwriting is often very like other people's&mdash;but
      directly it reached this box it became the property of the
      Postmaster-general. It is no more hers now than it is mine; and if I was
      to yield it up, it's a matter, madam, that might be brought before the
      assizes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs Rudd,&rdquo; said my Lady quietly, &ldquo;I hope, although your late husband and
      my son were not quite of the same way of thinking as to politics, that you
      do not look upon me in an unneighbourly light. I do not wish to insult you
      by offering you a bribe; but I may say this much, that nobody ever put me
      under an obligation yet, without my endeavouring to recompense them to the
      best of my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady&mdash;although I can't say as <i>I</i> have ever been
      overburdened with favours at your Ladyship's hands&mdash;I know what sugar
      and currants goes to the Abbey from Simmons' every week&mdash;enough for a
      regiment, I'm sure, and at such a price, too, and all because he voted
      blue&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voting blue, Mrs Rudd,&rdquo; interrupted my Lady, &ldquo;is nothing at all compared
      with the good service you would do me, if you could only oblige my maid in
      the matter of this letter. Her future happiness, I may say, is bound up in
      the mère fact of that little note arriving or not at its destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mr R. Derrick, Turf Hotel, Piccadilly</i>,&rdquo; muttered Mrs Rudd, looking
      at the address over the top of her silver spectacles. &ldquo;I should like to
      have half the Abbey grocery custom very much, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; whispered my Lady in broken tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I dare not do it,&rdquo; continued the post-mistress. &ldquo;This might be held
      over me&mdash;if it ever came to be known&mdash;so that I should never be
      my own mistress again, which, now that Rudd is gone, I mean to be. When
      you have once done an illegal action, my Lady, you may just as well be a
      slave&mdash;until you have taken your punishment. Somebody is sure to get
      wind of it, and to put you under their thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My Lady gave a ghastly smile, for speech was not in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mrs Rudd,&rdquo; interposed Mistress Forest softly, &ldquo;you are not
      asked either to destroy or to give up this letter&mdash;of the inside of
      which, if you please, I will tell you every word. It is written to my
      lover&mdash;that's the fact; and I am very, very anxious that he should
      receive it&rdquo;&mdash;here she trod upon my Lady's foot with unmistakable
      emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;should receive it by this night's post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so he will,&rdquo; returned the postmistress, &ldquo;in Piccadilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Mr Derrick is <i>not</i> in Piccadilly,&rdquo; urged the waiting-maid.
      &ldquo;The direction should he '<i>Care of Mr Arthur Haldane</i>'&mdash;what
      court is it, my Lady?&mdash;Yes; <i>Pump Court, Temple</i>. If you would
      only let me write <i>that</i>, Mrs Rudd, upon the envelope, instead of the
      present address, all mischief will be avoided. Would it not, my Lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems no great harm in that,&rdquo; said Mrs Rudd reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm whatever, and a great deal of good to you,&rdquo; murmured the
      waiting-maid, as with a rapid hand she crossed out the words already
      written, and substituted for them the address of Mr Haldane's
      law-chambers. &ldquo;Thank you kindly. Now, please to stamp this other. I am so
      much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said my Lady graciously. &ldquo;Be so kind, Mrs Rudd, as to let me
      take your list of groceries with me. What nice macaroni that looks&mdash;I
      find such a difficulty in getting it in the country pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Rudd herself accompanied my Lady to her chariot, and courtesied to the
      ground as the chariot whirled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner were they alone, than mistress and maid exchanged a hearty kiss.
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, dear Mary,&rdquo; cried the former; &ldquo;without your
      presence of mind, what should we have done! I began to feel quite
      prostrate with despair, and even now I tremble to think how nearly we had
      failed. I could not go through such a scene again, I believe, even if my
      life depended upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, you could, my Lady; and I only trust it may not be necessary for
      you to do so. There is nothing more, however, to be done at present, save
      to wait and hope&mdash;except the telegraph message. I ventured to tell
      John, 'To the Railway Station.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegraph to whom, and about what, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must let Mr Arthur know what he is to do with that letter, my Lady;
      otherwise, he may endeavour to forward it to the person to whom it is
      addressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, dear Mary. I do believe that my wits are leaving me. By all
      means telegraph 'Burn it.' I wish I could repay you for your prudent
      thought, as easily as I can recompense Mrs Rudd for her complaisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think of repaying me, my dear,&rdquo; replied the waiting-maid fondly.
      &ldquo;It is a heartfelt pleasure to find that I am not altogether useless in
      this strait. I am yours&mdash;yours&mdash;yours&mdash;my beloved mistress,
      and will be though every friend on earth should stand afar off, and you
      were forsaken by your very kith and kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God forbid that should ever be the case, Mary!&rdquo; ejaculated Lady
      Lisgard solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Amen,</i> my Lady&mdash;amen, I'm sure; but when the worst happens
      that can happen, you will please to remember you have Mary Forest still!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV. AN UNCHEERFUL PICNIC.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>Y the time Lady
      Lisgard returned to the Abbey, notwithstanding that the sleek bays had
      devoured the road with all the haste of which their condition permitted,
      it was long past the breakfast-hour, and her absence from that meal
      provoked no little comment from the members of her family. Nobody was able
      to allay their curiosity as to what could have taken mamma to Dalwynch,
      but Miss Aynton did her best to stimulate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone upon Mary Forest's account,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;that is all I
      can tell you. I never knew any one take such trouble about her maids as
      dear Lady Lisgard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rose,&rdquo; replied Letty warmly; &ldquo;but it is not every maid who has lived
      with her mistress thirty years. I believe Mary would lay down her very
      life for dear mamma, and indeed for any of us. Whenever I read those
      stupid letters in the papers about there being no good old servants to be
      seen now a days, I long to send the editor a list of our people at the
      Abbey. Mary, indeed, is quite a new acquisition in comparison with Wiggins
      and the gardener; but then she is almost faultless. I have heard mamma say
      that there has never been a word between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not between them, indeed, Letty,&rdquo; returned Miss Aynton laughing; &ldquo;for
      Mistress Forest has all the talk to herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard smiled grimly, for Mary had been in his bad books ever since
      her attachment to &ldquo;that vagabond Derrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, Miss Rose!&rdquo; cried Walter&mdash;&ldquo;very good. I wish I could say as
      much for this so-called new-laid egg. Why should eggs be of different
      degrees of freshness? Why not all fresh? Why are they ever permitted to
      accumulate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My egg is very good,&rdquo; observed Sir Richard sententiously; &ldquo;how is yours,
      Miss Aynton?&rdquo; and he laid an emphasis upon the name, in tacit reproof to
      his brother for having been so familiar as to say &ldquo;Miss Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir Richard, I am London-bred, you know, and therefore your country
      eggs, by comparison, are excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could think,&rdquo; said the baronet with stateliness, &ldquo;that in other
      matters we equally gained by contrast with Town, in your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe London is the place to get everything good,&rdquo; remarked Walter
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to-day, Miss Aynton,&rdquo; continued the baronet, without
      noticing the interruption, &ldquo;to offer you something which really cannot be
      got in town, and which hitherto the state of the weather has forbidden
      even here&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, for shame, Richard!&rdquo; interrupted Letty, holding up her hands. &ldquo;Now,
      that was to be a surprise for Rose.&mdash;It's a picnic, my dear. I
      daresay now you scarcely know <i>what</i> that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, then,&rdquo; ejaculated Walter with acidity: &ldquo;it's packing up
      all the things you would have in the ordinary course at luncheon in a
      comfortable manner&mdash;except the bread, or something equally necessary,
      which is always left behind&mdash;and carrying them about six miles to the
      top of an unprotected hill&mdash;in this particular case, to a tower
      without a roof to it&mdash;there to be eaten without tables or chairs, and
      in positions the most likely to produce indigestion that the human body
      can adapt itself to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always been told that being in a bad humour is the most certain
      thing to cause what you eat to disagree with you,&rdquo; observed Letty
      demurely.&mdash;&ldquo;Never mind what Walter says. I am sure you will be
      delighted, dear Rose; we are going to Belcomb, a sort of shooting-box
      belonging to us, about five miles away, and built by grandpapa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commonly termed 'Lisgard's Folly,'&rdquo; added Master Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by his descendants, however, I should hope, with one exception,&rdquo;
       observed Sir Richard haughtily.&mdash;&ldquo;I will thank you, Walter, not to
      cut my newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Walter had seized the paper-knife as though it had been a more
      deadly weapon, and was engaged in disembowelling one of a multiplicity of
      newspapers which had just arrived by post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see it was yours,&rdquo; returned he. &ldquo;Goodness knows, nobody wants
      to read the <i>Court Journal</i> but yourself. The idea of not liking
      one's newspaper cut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must say, my dear Richard,&rdquo; said Letty, playfully patting her
      elder brother, next to whom she sat, upon the shoulder, &ldquo;that is a most
      singular objection of yours, I think it certainly proves that you will
      always remain an old bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard maintained a frowning silence. Master Walter twirled his
      silken moustache, and looked up at Miss Aynton with a meaning smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your opinion upon the subject,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Miss Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Richard, rising so hastily that he knocked over
      the chair on which he had been sitting. &ldquo;How dare you ask such questions
      in my presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, Richard!&rdquo; cried a reproving voice; and lo! at the open door
      stood my Lady, hollow-eyed and pale, and with such a weariness and
      melancholy in her tones as would have touched most hearts.&mdash;&ldquo;Am I
      ever to find you and Walter quarrelling thus?&mdash;Yes, I have heard all,
      and think you both to blame; but nothing can excuse this violence. If I
      have any authority in this house at all, not another word, I beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard bit his lip, but resumed his seat; Walter went on quietly
      dissecting the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, with an air of intense
      interest; Miss Aynton very accurately traced the pattern of her plate with
      her fork; Letty, the innocent cause of the outbreak, shed silent tears.
      Altogether, the family picture was gloomy, and the situation embarrassing.
      My Lady reaped this advantage, however, that nobody asked her a word about
      her expedition to Dalwynch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let me detain you at table, my dear Letty,&rdquo; said she, breaking a
      solemn pause. &ldquo;Miss Aynton was so good as to make my coffee this morning,
      and therefore it is only fair that she should perform the same kind office
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad enough of this excuse to leave the room&mdash;a movement felt by all
      to be very difficult of imitation&mdash;Letty rushed up stairs to indulge
      in a good cry in her own bedroom, &ldquo;the upper system of fountains&rdquo; only
      having been yet in play. Sir Richard gloomily stalked away towards the
      stables; Walter lounged into the hall, lit a cigar, and paced to and fro
      upon the terrace beneath the windows of the breakfast-room, with both his
      hands in his pockets. Whiffs of his Havana, and scraps of the opera tune
      which he was humming, came in at the open window, to those who yet
      remained. My Lady had much too good taste to dislike the smell of good
      tobacco, and the air which he had chosen was a favourite one with her;
      perhaps Master Walter hummed it upon that account. He was to leave the
      Abbey next day to join his regiment&mdash;although not immediately. It was
      only natural he should wish to spend a few days in London after he had had
      so much of the quiet of Mirk, and yet my Lady grudged them. How pleasant
      everything about him was; how dull the Abbey would be without him; what a
      sad pity it was that he and Sir Richard got on so ill. If she were to die,
      would they not turn their hacks on one another for ever, and he brothers
      no more; and if something worse than Death were to happen to her&mdash;&mdash;No,
      she would not think of that. Had not all that could be done to avert such
      utter ruin been done that very morning? There was surely no immediate
      peril now&mdash;no necessity for such excessive caution and self-restraint
      as she had been obliged of late months to exercise; it was something to
      have breathing-space and liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are coming with us to the picnic, Lady Lisgard, now that that
      horrid man has gone?&rdquo; said a cold quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady, looking out of window at her favourite son, and lost in gloomy
      depths of thought, had entirely forgotten that she had invited Miss Rose
      Aynton to bear her company. She did not venture to look upon her
      questioner's face, though she felt that it was fixed on hers, reading
      Heaven knew what. How had she dared to think of liberty with this domestic
      spy under her very roof! What should she answer to this dreadful question?
      Something this girl must know, or must suspect, or she would never have
      ventured thus to allude a second time to the man Derrick, after her rebuff
      in the morning. Above all things, she would follow Mistress Forest's
      advice, and get Miss Aynton out of Mirk Abbey. She had intended to speak
      to her respecting what had just occurred at the breakfast-table; that
      would also offer an opportunity to say something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rose, I am going with you to Belcomb. It is a very favourite spot of
      mine&mdash;very. It was about that expedition, partly, that I wished to
      speak with you. I was about to ask you to be very careful in your conduct
      towards my sons this day. It is the last time they will be together for
      weeks, perhaps. Be kind to my poor Richard. Of course, Walter knew nothing
      of what has passed between you and his brother; but the bow which he drew
      at a venture sent home a barbed shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aynton bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were sorry for that, Rose, I know. You cannot fail to see how
      irritable he has lately grown, poor fellow. The fact is, he has
      overestimated the strength of his own powers of self-constraint. Your
      presence is a perpetual trial to him.&rdquo; My Lady paused, anticipating some
      reply to a hint so palpable; but Miss Aynton, who carried her fancy-work
      in her pocket, continued to develop a pansy in floss silk; and the flower
      opened in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under these circumstances, dear Rose,&rdquo; pursued my Lady, &ldquo;do you not think
      it would be better&mdash;I know how embarrassing it would be to you to
      propose it, and therefore, although your hostess, I relieve you of the
      task&mdash;do you not think it would, on the whole, be wiser for you to
      leave us a little sooner than you had intended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The humming of the opera tune, and the odour of the Havana, were growing
      more distinct, and the elastic footfall on the gravel was coming very
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I consulted my own feelings,&rdquo; returned Miss Aynton, in firm, clear
      tones, &ldquo;I should certainly have left Mirk before this, Lady Lisgard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Miss Aynton, for Heaven's sake!&rdquo; cried my Lady, &ldquo;the window is
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But unless Sir Richard himself,&rdquo; pursued the girl in more subdued
      accents, &ldquo;releases me from my promise to remain until after his birthday,
      I must, with your permission, madam, do so; otherwise, he might possibly
      imagine that <i>his</i> presence is too great a trial for <i>me</i>, and I
      should be loath indeed to have my departure so misconstrued.&rdquo; There was
      bitterness in the tone with which she spoke, but determination too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to understand, then,&rdquo; returned my Lady flushing, &ldquo;that contrary to
      my advice and wish&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, dear, here comes the Break,&rdquo; cried Master Walter, from the
      terrace beneath, in his ringing cheerful tones. &ldquo;I hope you have told
      Roberts about the prog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, yes,&rdquo; answered my Lady, lovingly even in her haste; then
      turning to the young girl, she whispered almost fiercely: &ldquo;At least, Miss
      Aynton, you will shape your behaviour this afternoon as I requested. There
      is no time now to discuss the other matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the butler entered the next moment with: &ldquo;The Break is at the
      door, my Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Break was a very roomy vehicle, with accommodation within it for
      three times the party who were now about to occupy it, beside two seats at
      the back, like flying buttresses, for footmen. Yet Sir Richard chose to
      sit upon the box beside the driver, a place only selected (unless for
      smoking purposes) by persons with &ldquo;horsey&rdquo; characteristics, who prefer
      coachman's talk to that of their equals, and among whom the baronet could
      not be justly classed; but the fact was, the young man was in an evil
      temper, and desired no companionship but his own. He would have seen the
      whole expedition at the bottom of the sea&mdash;a metaphor open to the
      gravest objections, but which he used while arguing the matter with
      himself aloud&mdash;if it were not that that fellow Walter was going&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;he
      was not going to let <i>him</i> have all the talk to himself, that was
      all. True, Sir Richard had given up the idea of transforming Miss Aynton
      into Lady Lisgard; but still it was not pleasant to see another man making
      himself exclusively agreeable to her. He was annoyed with himself at
      having exhibited such passion at the breakfast-table, for the more he
      thought of it, the more he felt convinced that Walter's remark, although
      doubtless intended to be offensive, had not been made with any knowledge
      of his own rejected suit. Still, he was in a very bad temper,-and listened
      to the conversation going on behind his back with a moody brow, and every
      now and then a parting of the lips, through which escaped something the
      reverse of a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Walter, of course, who was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inhabited!&rdquo; said he in answer to some question of Miss Aynton's; &ldquo;O dear,
      no. Belcomb never had a tenant but once, and I should think would never
      have another. One Sir Heron Grant and his brother took it two years for
      the shooting-season: a brace of Scotchmen whose ancestors dated from the
      Deluge, but so dreary a couple, that one wished that the family had
      started from a still earlier epoch, and been all washed away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Richard rather liked Sir Heron,&rdquo; observed Letty simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because he was a baronet; and birds of the same gorgeous plumage
      flock together, you know. There was nothing remarkable about him but his
      feathers, and he scarcely ever opened his mouth except to put food in it.
      It is said that in the old stage-coach times, he and his brother travelled
      from Edinburgh to London, and only uttered one sentence apiece. At York,
      the younger brother saw a rat come out of a wheat-rick. 'By Jove,' cried
      he, 'there's a rat!' The next morning, and after an interval of about
      eighty miles, Sir Heron replied: 'Ay, if Towser had seen that rat, he
      would have made short work of him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it appears, they agreed, at all events,&rdquo; returned Rose coldly.
      &ldquo;After all, even a foolish remark is better than an ill-natured one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scenery is getting well worth your attention here,&rdquo; observed Sir
      Richard, turning graciously round towards Miss Aynton. &ldquo;Belcomb is a
      complete solitude, but for those who are contented with the pleasures of
      the country, it is a pleasant spot enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we see the house from here, Sir Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not until we reach this Windmill, on the top of the hill. The private
      road branches out from the highway at that spot; and the mill is the
      nearest inhabited house to Belcomb.&mdash;By the by, mother, Hathaway must
      be spoken to about those sails of his&mdash;there, you saw how even old
      Jenny started at them&mdash;it is positively dangerous for horses to pass
      by. He must build up that old wall a foot higher, and put a gate up. Any
      stray cattle might wander in and get knocked down&mdash;the sails are so
      close to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Walter had not at all relished Miss Aynton's rejoinder to his
      story; still less had he liked his brother's striking into the
      conversation; least of all did he approve of this landlord talk about
      repairs and alterations, which reminded him of his being a younger son,
      and having neither part nor lot in the great Lisgard heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the Folly,&rdquo; cried he suddenly, with a view of changing the
      subject; &ldquo;upon that cliff-like hill yonder, above that belt of trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, that beautiful ivied tower!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; without a roof to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at all events, it's very pretty,&rdquo; said Miss Aynton reprovingly. &ldquo;I
      am sure, Mr Walter, you ought to be grateful to your grandpapa for
      building so picturesque an edifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have made a road, however, to it,&rdquo; observed Walter satirically;
      &ldquo;a road and a roof, I do consider to be indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a beautiful winding path through the wood, Rose,&rdquo; said Letty,
      &ldquo;fifty times better than any road; and is not the piece of water charming?
      It is the only one with any pretension to be called a Lake in all the
      county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Belcomb deserved praise. A small but comfortably furnished
      house, embosomed in trees, through which were the pleasantest peeps of
      hill and dale, and spread before it quite a crystal tarn, with rocky
      islands so picturesquely grouped that they almost gave the notion of being
      artificial. It was as though a segment of the Lake-country had been cut
      off, and inserted into the very midst of Wheatshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as lonely, too, to all appearance, as any Cumberland mère. An old
      man and his wife, who were in charge of the place, came hirpling out with
      respectful welcomes, and the latter was about to remove the shutters of
      the drawing-room, when my Lady interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rachel; we will not trouble you to do that. We are going to picnic at
      the Tower. You seem quite surprised to see us so early. I suppose nobody
      has been here yet upon the same errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, ma'am; nor is it likely, after your orders&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the fact is, mother,&rdquo; interrupted Sir Richard with a little stammer,
      &ldquo;I forgot to tell you about it; but Rinkel informs me there has been
      considerable damage done by parties coming here from Dalwynch and other
      places, and therefore he has put up a Notice to prohibit the whole thing
      in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, upon the path leading to &ldquo;the Folly,&rdquo; which could be
      approached by another way than that in front of the house, they presently
      came upon a board recently erected, which threatened Trespassers with all
      the rigour of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bitter sneer upon Captain Lisgard's handsome face, at this
      assumption of authority upon the part of his brother, and it did not
      soften when my Lady thoughtfully remarked: &ldquo;Ah, well; that will certainly
      make the place very private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious reply, as Letty thought, at the time, for her mother to make,
      who was always so eager to oblige her neighbours, and who well knew how
      popular Lisgard's Folly was with the humbler class of townsfolk in the
      summer months. But she was destined to be vastly more astonished before
      that day was spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little party, so strangely out of accord with one another, took their
      lunch, indeed, beneath the shadow of the Tower; but all those harmonious
      elements which are so absolutely essential to the success of a picnic were
      wanting. There were no high spirits, no good-humoured badinage, and not
      the ghost of a laugh. My Lady, singularly silent even for her, gazed
      around her on the familiar landscape, or regarded the shuttered cottage
      with a mournful interest, as though they reminded her of happier times.
      Miss Aynton, careful of what my Lady had enjoined, was studiously urbane
      to Sir Richard, but without obtaining the wished-for result; for while the
      baronet was thereby only rendered tolerably gracious, the captain grew
      intensely irritated. Poor Letty, who was the only one prepared to be
      agreeable, or had any expectation of enjoying herself, felt immensely
      relieved when the repast was concluded, and the horses were ordered to be
      &ldquo;put to.&rdquo; As for strolling about the grounds, and pointing out their
      varied beauties to Rose, as she had counted upon doing, that was no longer
      to be thought of. Sir Richard, as usual, offered his arm in stately
      fashion to his mother; but Master Walter, lighting a cigar, stood for a
      few minutes looking down with knitted brow upon the lake, then sauntered
      after them, without saying a word, and with both hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Rose,&rdquo; cried Letty, who watched these proceedings with little short
      of terror, &ldquo;what have you said to make Walter so cross? I never saw him
      behave like that in my life. He did not even look at you. Would it be very
      wrong if you just ran after him, and said a word or two before we got into
      the carriage? I am so dreadfully afraid of a quarrel between him and
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please, Letty,&rdquo; returned Miss Aynton, looking pale, and a
      little frightened too; and forcing a laugh, she tripped down the zigzag
      path in pursuit of the exasperated captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty waited a reasonable time, watching the footman collect the débris of
      the entertainment, and pack the plate, and then, supposing their
      difficulty had been adjusted, followed upon the track of her friend and
      Walter. The path was not only of considerable length, but so very steep,
      that one little zigzag overhung another; thus, as she descended, she
      perceived through the thin Spring foliage the two young people standing
      beneath her, although they were quite unconscious of her approach. She
      caught the last words of something Rose was saying; those were: &ldquo;Walter,
      dear.&rdquo; She marked the girl stretch her arms towards him, as though she
      would have clasped them round his neck; and then she saw Captain Lisgard,
      of her Majesty's Light Dragoons, put her roughly by, shake himself free of
      her with a movement expressive almost of loathing, and turn upon his heels
      with an oath.

      CHAPTER V. THE FINESSE IN TRUMPS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is the Night
      before the Derby. The West End is thronged with men. The streets are
      perceptibly more thronged with well-dressed males than at any other time
      in the year. The May meetings brought enough of parsons and sober-coated
      laity to dull the living tide&mdash;to almost make us Londoners a mournful
      people (which we are, naturally, <i>not</i>, despite what Frenchmen say);
      but those grave ones have either departed from us, or are now lost and
      undistinguishable in this influx of gay company. All the newcomers are in
      their most gorgeous raiment, for is not this the great &ldquo;gaudy&rdquo; week of the
      Wicked? Half the officers of cavalry in her Majesty's sendee have obtained
      leave of absence for eight-and-forty hours upon urgent private affairs;
      and a fourth of the infantry have done the like; they have come up from
      every station within the four seas to see the great race run, which is to
      put in their pockets from five pounds to fifty thousand. Over their little
      books they shake their shining heads, and stroke their tawny moustaches in
      a deprecating manner, but each one has a secret expectation that &ldquo;he shall
      pull it off this once;&rdquo; for, upon the whole, our military friends have not
      been fortunate in turf transactions. There is a fair sprinkling, too, of
      respectable country gentlemen, who rarely leave their families to occupy
      their old-bachelor quarters at <i>Long's</i> or the <i>Tavistock,</i>
      except on this supreme occasion. Every fast university-man who can obtain
      an <i>exeat</i> upon any pretence whatever&mdash;from sudden mortality in
      the domestic circle down to being <i>subpoenaed</i> by a friendly attorney
      in the supposititious case of Hookey (a blind man) v. Walker&mdash;is up
      in town resplendent, confident, Young. Every sporting farmer, save those
      in the north, who have a private saturnalia of their own in the
      mid-autumn, has left his farm for two nights and a day, and is seeing life
      in London. Besides these, an innumerable host of well-dressed scoundrels&mdash;for
      whom the word &ldquo;Welcher&rdquo; is altogether too commendable&mdash;have come up
      from country quarters, where they have been playing various &ldquo;little
      games,&rdquo; all more or less discreditable, to work together for evil with
      their metropolitan <i>confreres</i> for four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every haunt of dissipation is holding highest holiday. The stupid, obscene
      Cider Cellars find, for one night at least, that they have attractions
      still; the music-halls are tropical with heat and rankest human
      vegetation; Cremorne, after the crowded theatres have disgorged their
      steaming crowds, is like a fair. The strangers' room at all the clubs has
      been bespoken this night for weeks. In the card-rooms, the smoking-rooms,
      the billiard-rooms, there is scarcely space to move, far less to breathe
      in; yet there is everywhere a babblement of tongues, and the words that
      are most bandied about from feverish mouth to mouth, are first, <i>The
      King</i>, and secondly, <i>Menelaus</i>. The tout had kept his word&mdash;either
      from fear or nicest honour&mdash;until the stipulated week had elapsed,
      and then the news of the trial-race began to circulate: from his
      outsiders' place, to that of fourth favourite, then of third, and at last
      to that of second had &ldquo;the French horse&rdquo; gradually risen. A curious and
      illogical position enough&mdash;but then the turf-people <i>are</i>
      illogical&mdash;for if the news that he had beaten <i>The King</i> was
      true, he ought to have been first favourite; and if the news was <i>not</i>
      true, he had no reason to find favour at all. As it was, however, <i>The
      King</i> had come down half a point as if to meet him, to 9 to 2; while <i>Menelaus</i>
      stood at 5 to 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      And had that trial-race really taken place or not? and if so, Was it on
      the Square? was the question which was just then agitating the Houses of
      Lords and Commons (nay, it was whispered, Marlborough House itself), and
      all the mess-tables in her Majesty's service, more than any other subject
      in this world. There was also a vague rumour that the favourite's
      &ldquo;understandings&rdquo; were not as they should be; that there was a contraction
      that might be fatal to his prospects; that the idol's feet were of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Derrick had &ldquo;put the pot on&rdquo; his <i>Many Laws</i>, and would be a
      millionaire if he won; but Walter Lisgard had put more than the pot. If
      the French colours did not shew in front at the winning-post, the captain,
      still to use the elegant metaphor of the sporting fraternity, would be in
      Queer Street. So infatuated had the young man grown, that he had
      absolutely hedged even that one bet which insured him a thousand pounds in
      case <i>The King</i> should win the race. Notwithstanding his coyness in
      accepting the first offer of a loan from his uncultivated friend, he had
      borrowed of him twice since, in each case giving his I.O.U., whereby he
      endeavoured to persuade himself that he was liquidating all obligation;
      yet, unless he considered his mère autograph was worth the sums for which
      it was pledged, I know not how he succeeded in this. For if <i>Menelaus</i>
      did not happen to win, he not only would not have enough to discharge his
      debts of honour for nearly two years&mdash;when he would come into
      possession of his patrimony of five thousand pounds&mdash;but even a great
      portion of <i>that</i> would be bespoken. Thus, of course, he had placed
      himself, through mère greed, in a most unpleasant position; but at the
      same time it must be allowed that he had yielded to a great temptation,
      such as would probably have made the mouth of any financier water, had the
      opportunity offered in his particular line; for with the exception of mère
      outsiders, <i>The King</i> had beaten every horse that was to contend with
      him on the morrow; and <i>Menelaus</i>, to Walter's certain knowledge, had
      beaten <i>The King</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equinely speaking, then, it was a certainty that the French horse should
      win the Derby, in which case the young man's gains would be prodigious;
      for not only had he taken advantage of the original position of the animal
      in the betting, but as the odds grew less and less, had still backed him,
      until his possible winnings reached, on paper, to five figures; on the
      other hand, by this last piece of imprudence, his possible&mdash;&mdash;But
      no, it was <i>not</i> possible. &ldquo;Things surely wouldn't go so devilish
      cross with a fellow as that or to put the captain's thought in other
      words, the Government of the Universe being founded upon just principles,
      would never permit such a stupendous misfortune to overwhelm him; or, it
      might be, the gallant captain believed that Fortune was indeed a female,
      and would therefore hesitate to inflict calamity upon so pretty a fellow
      as himself. At the same time, the event of the morrow was so big with
      fate, that it was not pleasant to dwell upon it; and anything which could
      have prevented his mind from recurring to the same, would have been
      welcomed gladly. But there was but one thing that had the power to do
      this. His anxiety was far too deep to be flattered away by the smile of
      Beauty, or lost in the sparkle of Wine. The homoeopathic treatment, <i>similia
      similibus</i>, he felt was the only one that could now give him relief,
      and he therefore sought for rest from the cares of the racecourse in the
      excitement of the gaming-table. Do not, however, let it be supposed that
      the captain sought out any of those convenient establishments for the
      immediate transfer of property, which are guarded by iron doors, and
      always liable to the incursions of the police, who, upon breaking in,
      discover four-and-twenty gentlemen (one of whom has swallowed the dice),
      sitting round a green baize table in conversation about Music and the Fine
      Arts. Master Walter was rash in his speculations, but he was not madman
      enough to play chicken-hazard against foxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall try my luck with the <i>Landrails</i> to-night,&rdquo; observed
      he to his companion Derrick, stopping short in flaring Piccadilly, and
      biting-his nails. The two men had been occupying lodgings in the same
      house, the <i>Turf Hotel</i> being full; the younger finding a species of
      comfort in the society of the part-owner of <i>Menelaus</i>, who was even
      more confident of the success of that noble quadruped than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, my lad,&rdquo; returned the gold-finder simply, &ldquo;although I don't
      know what they are; and so as you take me with you, I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks ago, such a proposition would have, staggered the captain, or
      rather, he would have rejected it point-blank. To be seen in public with
      his uncouth and flashily-attired friend, was at that time a considerable
      trial to the fastidious light dragoon; but the immense interest which they
      had in common, had rendered the familiarity of the once odious Orson at
      first tolerable, and eventually welcome, and even necessary. He had taken
      him with him into quite exclusive circles, and, except on one occasion at
      <i>the Rag</i>, where Derrick, having drunk more champagne than was good
      for him, had offered to fight Major Pompus of the Fusiliers <i>for what he
      liked</i>, nothing unpleasant had taken place in consequence. Men
      observed: &ldquo;What a deuced rum fellow Lisgard brought with him the other
      night;&rdquo; but the said stranger had lost his money very good-naturedly at
      the whist-table, and it was understood that he had more to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such circumstances, the gentlemen-players were very charitable. Mr
      Ralph Derrick did not play a first-rate game at whist; very few persons
      who have not been brought up in good society do; but his performance was
      not so inferior as to make success impossible for a night or two, however
      certain the ruin that would have overtaken him in the long-run. Moreover,
      he was never &ldquo;put off his head&rdquo; by the largeness of the stake, his
      habitual lavishness in money-matters rendering him indifferent to that
      matter. Captain Lisgard, on the other hand, though an excellent player,
      considering his tender years, was liable to have his nerves disorganised
      at any crisis of a rubber upon which an unusual amount depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Master Walter, &ldquo;I'll try my luck at the <i>Landrails</i>,
      and you shall come, too, Ralph. Any member has a right to introduce whom
      he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even a miner from Cariboo&mdash;eh, Master Walter, provided he's got
      money in his pocket? Well, I'm their man, whether it's for whist or
      all-fours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>All-fours!</i>&rdquo; repeated the captain with irritation. &ldquo;Who ever heard
      of a gentleman playing at that game? Do, pray, be particular in what you
      say to-night. Whatever you do, call a knave a knave, and not a <i>Jack</i>.
      The <i>Landrails</i> is a very select place, Ralph, where men who like to
      play their whist more quietly than at <i>the Rag</i> look in for an hour
      or two rather late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavier stakes, I suppose?&rdquo; observed Derrick bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather. You see, there's always some row with the committee, if play
      gets beyond a certain height at the regular clubs. Now, this is a sort of
      friendly circle where the points are quite optional, and the bets too.
      Yes, I think I shall try my luck for a pony or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you look quite fit for whist, my lad, to-night,&rdquo; returned
      Derrick, gazing gravely into the young man's haggard face. &ldquo;To-morrow will
      be a trying day, remember; I think you had much better get to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do it, man!&rdquo; replied Walter vehemently&mdash;&ldquo;I dare not. I
      should never sleep a wink, and perhaps go mad with thinking before the
      morning. Look here, how my hand trembles. I have not nerves of iron, like
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad, poor lad!&rdquo; ejaculated the other with affectionate compassion.
      &ldquo;Nothing, as you say, ever makes me tremble&mdash;except D. T. Ah, Heaven,
      but that is terrible! Never drink, lad, never drink;&rdquo; and something like a
      shudder throbbed through the speaker's brawny frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Landrails</i> meet here,&rdquo; said Walter, stopping at the door of a
      private house in the neighbourhood of St James's Palace; &ldquo;it is past
      eleven, and I daresay play has begun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns this house?&rdquo; asked Derrick carelessly, surveying the
      unpretending tenement in question&mdash;&ldquo;or rather, who pays the rent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope <i>we</i> shall, Ralph, this evening. The fact is, the hire
      of the rooms, the attendance, and even the cost of the refreshments, are
      all defrayed each night by the winners in proportion to their gains. Money
      does not change hands until the ensuing week, but the secretary enters all
      accounts in his ledger, and sees that they are duly squared. I am
      answerable for your liabilities to-night, so do you be careful with the
      liquors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the youthful Mentor administered this wholesome piece of advice to his
      senior, the door opened, and they were admitted. It was a most respectable
      house, neither very large nor very small, and neatly but inexpensively
      furnished. The butler was a man who might have been the body-servant of an
      evangelical bishop, and whose conscience was troubled by the spiritual
      shortcomings of his right reverend master. To come upon so grave and sad a
      man upon the eve of the Derby Day, was quite a homily in itself. Through
      the open door of the dining-room could be seen a cold collation, at which
      men dropped in from above-stairs if they felt so disposed; but there were
      light refreshments in the drawing-room also, and a great variety of
      pleasant drinks. The <i>Landrails</i> were thirsty folks, and imbibed
      gallons of iced hock and Seltzer water; but they had not, as a rule, good
      appetites. There were three tables for whist, and one dedicated to piquet
      or écarté. All these had massive candlesticks screwed into their wood-work&mdash;perhaps
      only to prevent their falling off; but it also put a stop to any possible
      use of them as a weapon or missile, and I think that contingency had been
      also taken into account. A candlestick comes uncommonly handy to the
      fingers when luck has gone pertinaciously against one, and the man who has
      won all the money is personally hateful. Above all things, it was
      important, in that quiet, friendly circle, to repress all ebullition of
      temper, and to steer clear of all disputes. Nobody, one would hope, who
      was in a position to be admitted to that society, would stoop to cheating;
      but a little strap was inserted at the opposite corners of each table for
      the convenience of marking the score, wherein, when the counters were once
      placed, they could not he accidentally removed by the elbow. *
    </p>
    <p>
      * Persons who are acquainted with the game of whist have informed me, that
      it is sometimes better&mdash;in the case of holding two by honours, for
      instance&mdash;to be at three than four.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacious room&mdash;for it was a double drawing-room&mdash;was by no
      means brilliantly lit up; a couple of bare wax-candles stood upon the
      refreshment-table, where, by the by, there was no attendant, each man
      helping himself at pleasure; but the other four pair in the room had
      shades over them, which dulled their radiance, although it caused them to
      throw a very bright light upon the tables themselves. When the new-comers
      entered, which they did quite unannounced, the sight struck one of them at
      least as a very strange one: three shining isles of light&mdash;for one
      whist-table was not in use&mdash;amid a sea of gloom; ten thoughtful faces
      with a sort of halo round them, and one or two sombre ones standing by
      like their evil genii, and watching, the play. There was not a sound to be
      heard at first, except the dull fall of the pieces of pasteboard, but
      presently a hand being finished in their neighbourhood, a sort of hushed
      talk began about what would have happened if somebody had under-played the
      diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the points?&rdquo; whispered Derrick in his companion's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the points to-night, Beamish?&rdquo; inquired Walter of one of the
      four, a very unimpassioned-looking young man, who replied with a most
      unpleasant and ghastly smile&mdash;as though he had cut his throat a
      little too high up: &ldquo;Fives and fifties, my gallant captain, with the odds
      in ponies; so, being a younger son, I advise you to go to some other
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, I am going to make a good marriage,&rdquo; returned Walter coolly.
      Mr Beamish had been a penniless government clerk until he wedded the widow
      of an opulent builder with half a town for her jointure. &ldquo;If you are not
      full,&rdquo; added the captain, &ldquo;I declare in here, for myself and friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All four looked up for an instant at the threatened stranger; for your
      good player, intent on gain, detests the introduction of an unknown hand.
      Somehow or other, although the odds are two to one, &ldquo;it's always his
      cursed luck to have him for a partner.&rdquo; General Prim, who had been a
      martinet in the Peninsula, and as offensive to his fellow-creatures as
      less favourable circumstances had permitted ever since, gave a ferocious
      grin, and shook his single scalp-lock of gray hair like a malignant
      pantaloon. The Hon. Pink Hawthorne, attache at the court at Christiana,
      but absent from that lively capital upon sick-leave, wrenched his fair
      moustache this way and that, and frowned as gloomily as his foolish
      forehead would permit. The dealer, a Mr Roberts, an ancient bencher of one
      of the Inns of Court, paused with the trump card in his fingers still
      unturned. &ldquo;Does your friend know what the Blue Peter means, Lisgard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been a sailor half my life, sir, and it's devilish odd if I did <i>not</i>.&rdquo;
       returned Ralph Derrick grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil did the fellow mean?&rdquo; added he to Walter as the game
      began, and all the four became at once automatons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the new system of asking for trumps,&rdquo; answered Walter peevishly.
      &ldquo;The same thing that they called the Pilot the other night. How ridiculous
      you have made yourself. See, there's another table up. Bless the man, not
      there, that's the piquet place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph had quietly seated himself next to Major Piccalilli, of the
      Irregular Cavalry, Cayenne Station, Upper India, and had already disturbed
      his marking-cards, whereby that gallant officer was reduced to the verge
      of apoplexy with speechless rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, you shall stick to this one,&rdquo; continued Walter in a low voice;
      &ldquo;that fellow Beamish is hateful to me&mdash;and I will cut in yonder.
      There is not a muff-table in the room&mdash;all these beggars play too
      well.&rdquo; With these words, the captain hurried away; and as soon as the
      rubber he had been watching was finished, Derrick was admitted of the
      conclave, to the exclusion of General Prim, who cursed that circumstance
      very audibly, and for a man of his advanced years, with considerable
      emphasis and vigour. Derrick fell as a partner to the lot of the gentleman
      who had inquired as to his proficiency in the art of asking for trumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would only hold your cards a <i>little</i> more on the table, I
      should be able to see them myself,&rdquo; remarked Mr Roberts with severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they look over my hands, sir,&rdquo; returned Derrick reassuringly, &ldquo;I'll
      forgive 'em: that's all.&mdash;If you won't take that old gentleman's
      bets&rdquo;&mdash;referring to the general, who seemed extremely anxious to back
      their adversaries&mdash;&ldquo;then I will;&rdquo; and he did it&mdash;and luck went
      with him. There was nothing stronger than champagne to be got at in that
      respectable place of business, so Ralph kept his head, and won&mdash;a
      hundred and fifty pounds or so. Then, the table breaking up, he rose and
      stood over his young friend, to see how the cards were going with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; muttered Derrick to himself, as he watched Walter running through
      his hand with eager haste, as a woman flirts her fan. His beautiful face
      was dark with care, his eyes flashed impatiently upon the man whose turn
      it was to lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our odds are in fifties, eh, Lisgard?&rdquo; drawled his right-hand adversary,
      Captain and Lieutenant Wobegon of the Horse Guards' azure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as before, I suppose,&rdquo; returned the young man haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph gave a prolonged whistle. His young friend had a treble up, and the
      others nothing, so that he must be betting two hundred and fifty pounds to
      one hundred; and &ldquo;the same as before&rdquo; too! Within the next minute, the
      cards were thrown down upon the table, and the adversaries scored a treble
      likewise. &ldquo;That's been my cursed luck, Ralph, all to-night!&rdquo; cried the
      young man with a little grating laugh. &ldquo;Four by honours against one every
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been doing something devilish bad, Lisgard,&rdquo; observed the
      Guardsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have&mdash;playing!&rdquo; answered Walter bitterly. &ldquo;But no fellow <i>can</i>
      play with sixes and sevens; it demoralises one so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All cards do, my grandmother says,&rdquo; answered Wobegon, who for a Guardsman
      was not without humour. &ldquo;She made me promise, when she paid my debts, my
      first Derby, that I would never back anything again; and I never have,
      except my luck and bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lisgard had naturally a keen appreciation of fun, but he did not
      vouchsafe a smile to the facetious Guardsman, who himself joked like an
      undertaker, and had never been known to laugh in his life. The fact was,
      that nothing could just now commend itself to Master Walter except winning
      back his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, did you ever play for more than you can afford? Pardon me the
      inquiry; there is no occasion to be Pharisaical; for it is even possible
      to do worse things than that in your line: moreover, the question of what
      is more than you can afford is such a large one, and affords such
      opportunities for a nimble conscience to escape. I remember in Lord
      Houghton's <i>Life of Keats</i>, that that gallant nobleman, in defending
      the poet from the charge of dissipation and gambling, remarks that it all
      arose from his having lost ten pounds upon a certain evening at cards.
      How, considering that the author of <i>Hyperion</i> had no income, nor any
      bank except his Imagination to apply to&mdash;and it was notorious that he
      could never put a cheque even upon <i>that</i>&mdash;I take his Lordship
      to be a very charitable peer. Ten pounds must have been, for Keats, a
      large sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, undoubtedly, the matter is one for a man to decide for himself; the
      whole question is relative; and if you are apt to lose your temper, then
      remember you play for more than you can afford, although your stakes are
      but&mdash;penny-stamps. Captain Walter Lisgard had lost his temper and his
      money also. There was a numbed sense of misfortune pervading him; it
      seemed to him as though he was Predestinated to lose. I am much mistaken
      if he had not a sort of humming in his ears. One of the most religious men
      whom it has been my fortune to meet, has informed me that, in his
      unregenerate days, when he was a gambler and everything else, * he once <i>prayed
      to win</i> at cards.&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      * &ldquo;Every sin, sir, in the Decalogue, I am glad to say, have I committed&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
      that the present change in him was rendered thereby all the more
      satisfactory&mdash;&ldquo;with the sole exception of murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it strikes me.&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in addition to your other backslidings at
      the time you speak of, you were just a trifle blasphemous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I think not. All that I possessed in the world was
      depending upon the result of a certain game at écarté. If I had lost it, I
      should have been a beggar. If I won it, I resolutely resolved never to
      touch a card again&mdash;never to run the risk of experiencing a second
      time the mental agony I was then undergoing. I am not ashamed to confess,
      sir, that in such a strait I prayed to win; and I <i>did</i> win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I have to say, sir,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;is this: that it was uncommonly hard
      upon the other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good resolutions are indeed by no means uncommon among tolerably young
      persons in positions of pecuniary peril, such as that of Captain Lisgard.
      They vow their candles to this and that patron saint if they should but
      escape shipwreck upon the green baize this once. Master Walter's bid was
      confined to a few &ldquo;dips,&rdquo; if one may use so humble a metaphor, of which
      about fifty went to the pound, and even those were not offered in a
      penitent spirit. He would never play whist with the Landrails any more. He
      would never lay the long odds beyond &ldquo;couters&rdquo;&mdash;a foolish word he and
      his set used for sovereigns. He would never back himself at all when
      playing with &ldquo;that fool Pompus&rdquo;&mdash;his present partner. He would
      become, in short, exceedingly wise and prudent, if he should only &ldquo;pull
      off&rdquo; this present rubber. There was &ldquo;life in the Mussel&rdquo; yet. They were at
      &ldquo;three all&rdquo; when Pompus led his knave instead of his ten, from ten, knave,
      king, and only got the trick when he should have got the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never have another chance now,&rdquo; sighed Walter, as his left-hand
      adversary turned up the queen. But privately he thought that fortune would
      not be quite so cruel as all that came to; moreover, he had an excellent
      hand. His fingers trembled as he arranged the long suit of clubs, headed
      by tierce major, and saw that he had four trumps to bring them in with.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the game went on, however, Pompus exhibited his usual feebleness, and
      things began to look very black indeed. In the third round of trumps,
      Master Walter's memory left him sudden as an extinguished taper. It is sad
      to have to say it of so excellent a player, but he recollected nothing
      whatever, except that, if he lost that rubber, it would be an addition of
      three hundred pounds to the sum he already owed Captain Wobegon. It was
      his turn to play, and he was third hand. He had the king and ten of
      trumps. The ace had been played; ay, he remembered that after a struggle,
      and the knave too. Yes, his left-hand adversary had played the knave.
      Should he finesse his ten or not? That was the question, upon the decision
      of which depended some five hundred pounds. Whist is not always a game of
      pleasure. Master Walter finessed the ten. &ldquo;Thousand devils!&rdquo; cried Derrick
      with a tremendous imprecation, &ldquo;why, the queen was <i>turned up</i> on
      your left, lad: you have thrown away the game.&rdquo; And it was so. Walter
      Lisgard did not speak a word; but having compared his note-book with that
      of Captain Wobegon, retired into a little office out of the back
      drawing-room, where the secretary of the <i>Landrails</i> entered the
      members' somewhat complicated little accounts with one another in a very
      business-like-looking ledger. &ldquo;You have had a bad night of it for <i>you</i>,
      sir,&rdquo; remarked this gentleman quietly; &ldquo;you generally hold your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What is the cursed total?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph Derrick,&rdquo; said Walter Lisgard, as the two walked up St James's
      Street towards their lodgings for bath and breakfasts, but scarcely for
      bed, since the morning was already far advanced&mdash;&ldquo;if any horse but <i>Menelaus</i>
      wins the race, I am a ruined man.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI. MR WITHERS WITHDRAWS HIMSELF.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Derrick and
      the captain met at the breakfast-table upon that Derby morning, there was
      a note for the latter waiting by his plate. It had been brought over from
      the <i>Turf Hotel</i> with apologies, having been detained there by
      mistake, &ldquo;through everybody being so busy,&rdquo; for at least a week. As he
      turned it moodily over without opening it, Ralph saw that it had the Mirk
      postmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a letter from home, I see, lad; lucky dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very lucky,&rdquo; replied the young man cynically, as he ran his eye over
      the contents; &ldquo;worse than my infernal luck of last night, and only less
      than the misfortune I am looking for to-day is the news in this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will hear some day.&rdquo;&mdash;Here he took the note, and slowly
      tore it lengthways into thin strips, and then across, so that it lay in a
      hundred fragments.&mdash;&ldquo;But it's a secret, at least it was until a week
      ago, but being in a woman's hands, of course she let it slip;&rdquo; and Master
      Walter looked as near to &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; as it was possible for his handsome face
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied your folks at home were unaware of your having intended to be
      at the <i>Turf Hotel</i>, and rather thought you were with your regiment,
      like a good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain returned no answer; but Derrick, who was in excellent spirits
      notwithstanding the anxieties of the coming day, continued to address him
      in that healthy and cheerful strain which is the most intolerable of all
      manners to one who is melancholy, and what is worse, in dread suspense.
      &ldquo;Now, for my part, Walter, any letter in a woman's hand, as I think yours
      is&mdash;nay, you foolish lad, if you hadn't stuffed it into your
      breast-pocket so quickly, I protest I should have thought it had come from
      your mother or your sister. Why, you don't mean to say that that pretty
      little gate-keeper down at Mirk writes letters to handsome Master Walter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; asked the captain defiantly. &ldquo;If it had come from Mistress
      Forest, then, indeed, you might have taken upon yourself to object,
      although I understand that even there, you have not yet obtained the
      position of bridegroom-elect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Derrick drily. &ldquo;I was about to say that <i>I</i> should
      have welcomed any letter in a woman's hand, especially if it began: 'My
      dearest '&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean by looking over my letter?&rdquo; exclaimed Master
      Walter, starting up in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the other, purple with laughter and muffin; &ldquo;I never
      dreamed of such a thing. But since you said it came from the gate-keeper's
      daughter, I thought I'd make a shot. The idea of my wanting to read all
      the pretty things the little fool writes to a wicked young dog like you;
      it's no fun to me to watch a moth at a candle. But what a spoiled lad it
      is! Why, here I have had no letter at all from Mirk, and yet I am content.
      Silence gives consent, they say; and particularly in this case, when I
      know nothing but your lady-mother prevents Mary writing 'My dearest Ralph'
      to me. Indeed, if she wrote 'Dear sir, I can have no more to do with you,'
      it would not have the smallest effect. What I have made up my mind to do,
      generally comes to pass. Where there's a <i>will</i>&mdash;that is,
      supposing it is strong enough&mdash;there is most times a <i>way</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're a devil of a fellow,&rdquo; sneered Master Walter, rising and
      gazing out of window at the bustling street already astir with the Derby
      vehicles; &ldquo;but I am afraid your <i>will</i> can't win me this race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's done a great deal towards it, Captain Lisgard. It brought about the
      trial-race with the 'crack,' although my Lord did give himself such cursed
      airs, and not only let you in for a good thing, but lent you the money to
      take advantage of it to the uttermost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said Walter frankly, and holding out his thin white hand.
      &ldquo;I daresay you think me an ungrateful beast, but I'm worried by a matter
      that you know nothing of; besides&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not another word, lad&mdash;not another word; I am a rude rough creature,
      and I said some unpleasant things myself.&mdash;Here is our Hansom, and
      with light-green curtains of gauze. I'm cursed if I go down to Epsom with
      the colours of <i>The King</i> on my cab. Why, the beggar must have done
      it to insult us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense, Ralph; it's only to keep off the dust. If you have no
      curtains, you must wear a veil, that's all. Look there, in yonder
      barouche-and-four, every man has a green veil on. By Heaven! that
      Wobegon's one of 'em. He's got my I.O.U. for fifteen hundred pounds in his
      waistcoat-pocket; and there's that ugly devil Beamish, too.&mdash;Well,&rdquo;
       muttered the captain to himself, &ldquo;I'm glad I didn't go with <i>that</i>
      party, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Walter, who was as popular in town as elsewhere, had been asked to
      take a seat for that day in half-a-dozen &ldquo;drags&rdquo; and barouches, but he had
      preferred to go alone with Derrick; not that he enjoyed his companionship,
      but because, as I have before said, he gathered some comfort from his
      society under the present cloud of anxiety and apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Walter, you are a pretty fellow; you forgot all about the
      provisions, but see here!&rdquo; cried Derrick triumphantly, pulling a hamper
      from under the sofa; &ldquo;a pigeon-pie, a fowl, two bottles of champagne, and
      one of brandy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What confounded nonsense!&rdquo; returned the young man peevishly. &ldquo;There are
      dozens of parties who would have given us lunch. The idea of a hamper on
      the top of a Hansom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come, you are wrong anyway, <i>there</i>, lad, for I have seen a
      dozen going by this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, and you have also seen plenty of vans, each with a barrel of
      ale. However, it's of no consequence. If the Frenchman wins, I could eat
      periwinkles out of a hand-barrow with a hair-pin; and if he loses&mdash;why,
      then, I shall not have much appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, lad,&rdquo; replied Derrick gravely, &ldquo;this sort of thing won't do.
      Never be down on your luck, until, at all events, your luck is down upon
      you. You are not cut out for this work, <i>I</i> can see. A man ought to
      be sanguine, yet cool; hopeful of gain&mdash;yet quite prepared for loss,
      who goes in for such a stake as you have got upon to-day's race. A gambler
      should be all brain, and no heart: let me suggest, before we start, that
      you should just take a little brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; ejaculated the captain impatiently. &ldquo;If I am a funk, as you so
      delicately hint, I am not a fool. Come, let's be off. The next, time I see
      this room again, I shall be a made man&mdash;or a beggar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To any man, who risks by betting more than he can conveniently spare, the
      going to the Derby is by no means a cheerful expedition, whatever his
      coming home may chance to be; and further, it may be observed, that of all
      professional persons, those who take up the Turf as their line in life,
      are the most sombre and unlively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of them are clever fellows enough, and one or two are honest men, but
      there is no such thing as fun among them. The Ring would never take to the
      snow-balling one another, as the stock-brokers have been known to do when
      'Change was dull. They have only a certain grim and cruel humour, such as
      the Yankees use, the point of which lies always in overreaching one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derrick was right when he said that Master Walter was not fit for such a
      calling, but the same thing might, almost with equal force, have been said
      of himself. He was not, indeed, of an anxious disposition, but his temper,
      when once roused, was almost demoniacal, and he could never stand being
      cheated. Now, Cheating, in some form or other, is the soul of the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever it is possible to trot in that vast procession down to Epsom, the
      appearance of which is so gay, and the pace so funereal, the large-wheeled
      Hansom does it. Many a pretentious four-in-hand did the captain and
      Derrick pass, and many a wicked-looking brougham with its high
      stepping-steeds; and the occupants of each had often a word to say about
      &ldquo;the fellow with the beard that Lisgard had picked up, and was carrying
      about with him everywhere.&rdquo; For the manly growth that fringed Ralph
      Derrick's chin was something portentous, even in these days of beards, and
      his appearance was rendered still more striking from the fact of his
      wearing an infinite number of wooden dolls in the band of his hat, where
      Louis XI. used to stick the images of his patron saints. In vain Walter
      had informed him that this was a weakness only indulged in by snobs. Ralph
      rejoined (but not without an extra tinge of red in his weatherbeaten
      cheek), that being a snob himself, it was therefore only natural that he
      (Ralph) should take pleasure in thus adorning himself. He had rather be a
      snob than a nob, by a precious sight; he knew that. As for making an
      exhibition of himself, if that was really the case, it was only right that
      the public should be advertised of the matter, so he purchased a penny
      trumpet, and executed thereon the most discordant flourishes. &ldquo;Say another
      word, lad,&rdquo; added he, with cheerful malice, &ldquo;and blessed if I don't buy a
      false nose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter made no further remonstrance; he leaned back in the Hansom as far
      he could, and as much behind the green gauze curtain, until they reached
      the course, when his companion divested himself of the objectionable
      ornaments, and made a present of a live tortoise, which he had also
      acquired on the way, to an importunate gipsy woman, instead of crossing
      her palm as requested &ldquo;with a piece of silver.&rdquo; They could hear by this
      time the hum and the roar of the great human sea which surged about the
      railings in front of the Grand Stand, and in a few minutes more they were
      within them. They pushed their way through the babbling throng towards a
      certain corner that had been agreed upon, and there was Mr Tite Chifney
      waiting for them, with a very pale face indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong with the horse, is there?&rdquo; cried Ralph in a loud and
      menacing voice, which caused not a few sharp eyes to glance cunningly
      towards them, and set not a few sharp ears to listen to what might come
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, nothing,&rdquo; returned the trainer. &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, speak low. I
      never saw him looking better in my life. We will see him now, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Blanquette?&rdquo; continued Ralph, a little reassured by this, as they
      moved away towards the Paddock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Blanquette is not here, Mr Derrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here? Why, he was to join you the day before yesterday, otherwise I
      would have come myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>has</i> been here, sir, but he's gone away again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Is he not coming back to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, sir; I most sincerity hope so; but the fact is&mdash;now take
      'it quietly, for it's none of my fault&mdash;he's gone after Jack
      Withers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, while Walter ejaculated a smothered cry of agony and wrath,
      Derrick had seized the trainer by the throat. &ldquo;You know me, sir,&rdquo; cried
      he. &ldquo;As I swore to treat that tout on the Downs at Mirk, so will I treat
      you, if that jockey&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But two blue-coated men had thrust themselves between the strong man and
      his victim; a gentleman in a tight-buttoned frock-coat was coming up, too,
      in plain clothes, with that swift determined stride peculiar to members of
      &ldquo;the force,&rdquo; and the crowd grew very thick about them, and a thousand eyes
      were being concentrated upon Ralph's furious face, he knew. If his temper
      was lost now, he felt that all was lost. With an effort that almost cost
      him a fit of apoplexy&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I laid my hand
      upon you, Mr Chifney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; returned the trainer quietly, arranging his neckcloth. &ldquo;Mr
      Inspector, you know me, and there is no occasion for your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr Chifney, but you have got a rummish customer to deal with
      there,&rdquo; replied the guardian of the law, stroking his chin, and looking at
      Derrick, much as a vice-president of the Zoological Society might regard a
      novelty in wild beasts, that had been half-promised to the establishment,
      and then withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been treated thus,&rdquo; complained the trainer, as the three
      moved away, and the gaping crowd gathered round some other object of
      attraction, &ldquo;and have never deserved such treatment from any employer of
      mine, although I have kept racing-stables these thirty years. I can make
      some allowance for one who has so much money on this horse, as I know <i>you</i>
      have, Mr Derrick, but I give you my honour and word that I was as
      astounded as Mr Blanquette himself, when I heard the news that Jack had
      skedaddled. He was your own jockey, remember, not mine: no boy in my
      stables has ever played such a scurvy trick as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any boy that can take this scoundrel's place?&rdquo; asked Captain
      Lisgard impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got as good riders as can be got, Master Walter, upon so short a
      notice; and <i>Menelaus</i> shall have the pick of them. But you know what
      a devil of a temper the horse has; and this Withers was the only lad who
      understood him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes it that Blanquette has gone to look for him?&rdquo; asked Derrick
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;Does he know where he is likely to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as I know of, sir,&rdquo; returned the trainer gravely, &ldquo;He said he would
      bring him back Dead or Alive&mdash;those were his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a moment, Chifney,&rdquo; ejaculated Ralph. &ldquo;I can scarcely find breath to
      utter even the suspicion of it; and the certainty would, I verily believe,
      choke me; but do you think it possible that all is not quite on the square
      with Blanquette himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr Derrick, I'd rather not say. Mr Blanquette is as much the owner
      of the horse as yourself. He's my employer too&mdash;and nobody ever heard
      Tite Chifney breathe a word&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thousand devils!&rdquo; cried Derrick, stamping his foot so that the print of
      it was left in the yielding turf; &ldquo;is this a time for your senseless
      scruples? I ask you, do you think it possible that this man&mdash;my pal
      for years, one that has oftentimes faced death in my company, and once
      shared the last scanty meal that stood between us and starvation&mdash;do
      you think it possible, I say, that this man has sold the race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr Chifney frankly, &ldquo;about victuals eaten under the
      circumstances you describe, of course I'm no judge; but as to friendship
      and that, I've known a son play his own father false upon the turf before
      now; and what an Englishman will do in the way of smartness, you may take
      your oath a Frenchman will do&mdash;and a deuced sight worse too.
      Moreover, since you press this question, I may say that your partner has
      been seen talking with Wiley&mdash;Lord Stonart's agent&mdash;more than
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, in the devil's name, was I not told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not my business, Mr Derrick; you might not have thanked me for
      interfering with your affairs. I thought that you and Mr Blanquette were
      one. Besides, to confess the truth, I thought it was <i>The King</i> who
      was being nobbled. And since Lord Stonart has chosen to withdraw his
      horses from my keeping&mdash;chiefly, by the by, through his disgust at
      that trial-race in which his crack was beaten&mdash;I, of course, was no
      longer bound to look after his interests; no, indeed, quite the reverse,&rdquo;
       added the trainer with an offended air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did this Frenchman say he would be here to-day, if he did not find the
      boy?&rdquo; inquired Captain Lisgard sharply, with an unpleasant look in his
      fine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer that question for him,&rdquo; returned the gold-digger grimly. &ldquo;If
      he has played me false, he will not only not be <i>here</i>; he will have
      put the sea&mdash;and not the narrow one either&mdash;between himself and
      Ralph Derrick; for he knows me very well. But now&rdquo;&mdash;here he drew a
      long breath, and made a motion with his mighty arms as though he would
      dismiss that matter for the present, tempting as it was to dwell upon&mdash;&ldquo;let
      us see the boy that is to take this rascal's place. We may pull through
      still with luck.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII. AT EPSOM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVE you ever seen
      at the beginning of a Great Law Case a certain hush and stir among the
      gentlemen of the long robe, and then a young man rise&mdash;not much over
      forty, that is&mdash;and inform &ldquo;my lud&rdquo; that his unfortunate client was
      placed at a sad disadvantage, for that, through the unexpected but
      unavoidable absence of his leader, the whole case must needs devolve upon
      his own (the junior's) shoulders? The circumstance is of course most
      lamentable, but still the young counsel (if he is worth a guinea fee) has
      a certain confident radiance about him, for he feels that his opportunity
      has come at last, and that he has but &ldquo;to grasp the skirts of happy
      chance,&rdquo; to be borne from that moment woolsackwards. So was it with Mr
      Samuel Hicks, horse-jockey unattached, when suddenly called upon to fill
      the vacant seat of Brother Withers, absent without leave. To ride a Derby
      at a moment's notice was, to one in his position, almost what to take the
      command of the Mediterranean squadron would be to a young gentleman at the
      naval school. But not a trace of indecision was visible on the young
      centaur's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do my best, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he modestly; then added, with the
      irrepressible assurance of his class, &ldquo;and I think I know how to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing, and are an infernal young fool,&rdquo; returned the trainer
      sharply. &ldquo;You never were outside of such a horse as <i>Menelaus</i> in
      your life. If he is in a good temper, a child might steer him; but if he
      jibs&mdash;if he stands stock-still in that great race an hour hence, as
      he is as like to do as not&mdash;what will you do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, sir,&rdquo; cried the boy, his golden Future&mdash;not without
      &ldquo;mother in a comfortable cottage, and easy for life,&rdquo; let us hope, in the
      foreground&mdash;all swept away by this relentless prediction&mdash;&ldquo;Bless
      my soul, sir, I think I should cut his throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like this fellow,&rdquo; cried Derrick, slapping the lad upon the back. &ldquo;Look
      you, here is twenty pounds, which you may keep in any case, and you had
      better take it now, for if you lose the race, there will be plenty of
      folks to want all my money. But if you win, boy, I will make it Two
      Hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will make it Four,&rdquo; added Master Walter fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you see, you will be a made man for life,&rdquo; remarked the trainer
      kindly. &ldquo;But listen to me, Sam, or else all this glitter will be the
      merest moonshine. Be sure never touch your horse with whip or spur; for
      Withers, I have noticed, never did. But if the beast jibs&mdash;I saw Jack
      do this at the trial-race, and once before&mdash;snatch at his ear. There
      may be some secret in the way of handling it, but there is no time for
      finding that out. Do you twist it hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sir, I'll twist it off, but he shall win,&rdquo; returned the jockey
      plaintively; and off he went to don his new owner's colours&mdash;black
      and red&mdash;as proudly as an ensign to his first battle-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had got about that there was some hitch about <i>Menelaus</i>, and the
      odds were rising rapidly against him; and when the large and somewhat
      ungainly animal took his preparatory canter in front of the stand under
      the guidance of the uncelebrated Hicks, they rose still higher. If any of
      his ancient confidence had remained to Captain Lisgard, he could scarcely
      have resisted the tempting offers that were being roared out in harsh and
      nasal tones from every quarter of the Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay 7 to 1 against <i>Many Laws</i>&rdquo; (for most of the racing
      fraternity favoured Mr Derrick's pronunciation of that name); &ldquo;I'll lay 8
      to 1.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take 4 to 1. I name the Winner&rdquo; (for the relation between <i>The
      King</i> and the French horse in the betting was that of buckets in a
      well).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take odds that <i>Menelaus</i> is not placed,&rdquo; exclaimed a shrill and
      sneering voice close beside where the two men most interested in that
      depreciated animal were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What odds will you take, my Lord?&rdquo; inquired Captain Lisgard, biting his
      lip in wrath, for it was Lord Stonart who was offering them, the man whose
      confidential agent had been talking with Blanquette, and to whose
      machinations it was almost certainly owing that <i>Menelaus</i> had lost
      his rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lisgard, how are you?&rdquo; returned he coolly. &ldquo;How came it that I missed
      you just now in the Paddock? Haven't seen you since that morning on Mirk
      Down. So we're going to try that race over again, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you were asking for odds, my Lord, about the black horse being <i>placed?</i>&rdquo;
       rejoined the captain, pale with passion at the sarcasm that lurked in the
      other's tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I was. There has something gone amiss, they say, with him. I'll
      take 4 to 1 in fifties&mdash;hundreds, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do it,&rdquo; whispered Derrick eagerly. &ldquo;Don't you see what the
      scoundrel reckons upon? If the horse runs straight, he will win the race,
      but if he jibs, he will be nowhere. He is therefore taking odds where he
      ought to give them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't take me, eh?&rdquo; continued his Lordship. &ldquo;Well, I think your
      friend advises you wisely. See, the horses are moving towards the hill
      Like myself, you have no stall, I conclude. Where are you going to place
      yourself? I think I shall remain below here on the green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall see the race from the roof my Lord,&rdquo; answered the captain
      savagely, and thither he and his companion betook themselves accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To look down from that elevation upon Epsom Downs just before the start
      for the Great Race, is to behold a wondrous spectacle. Men&mdash;a quarter
      of a million or so&mdash;as black and thick as bees, and emitting much
      such a hum and clangour as attends the swarming of those perilous insects;
      and the carriages, twelve deep&mdash;dwarfed to much the same proportions
      as those chariots which used to be dragged in public by the Industrious
      Fleas. But raise your race-glass, and with a single sweep you survey every
      social degree of human life; from the duchess to the poor drunken hag on
      the look-out for empty bottles; from the peer to the ragged thief who
      bides his moment to snatch his booty from his Lordship's carriage-seat.
      This rascal's opportunity is coming. If there are five minutes in an
      Englishman's life in which he is indifferent to the preservation of his
      property, it is those five which are now at hand when that little jockey
      rainbow yonder is gathering on the hill. Thirty of the fleetest horses in
      the world are about to contend for the greatest prize that horse can win:
      it is not that circumstance, however, which makes so many hearts go
      pit-a-pat, keeps all lips sealed, and rivets every eye, except that of the
      pickpocket and his natural enemy the policeman, upon that shifting speck
      of colour. All are aware of the enormous interests that hang upon the
      result impending, even if they have none themselves; vague hut gigantic
      shadows of loss and gain forecast themselves upon every mind. In a few
      seconds more, certain unknown scoundrels&mdash;fellow-creatures, however,
      with whom we have indissoluble sympathies&mdash;will be enriched beyond
      the dreams of avarice; and certain other poor devils will be ruined. A
      solemn hush pervades all Pandemonium. The very organ-grinders cease their
      hateful discord; the vendors of race-cards give their lungs brief respite;
      the proprietors of <i>Aunt Sallies</i> intermit their useless cry of
      &ldquo;Three throws a penny,&rdquo; and stand on tiptoe, with their <i>fasces</i>
      beneath their arms, as eager as my Lord who totters insecure erect upon
      the front seat of his drag. Nervous folks see all these things because
      they cannot keep their eyes fixed where they would. A sudden roar breaks
      forth, not in the least like human speech, but it means that They are Off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Are</i> they off, Ralph?&rdquo; inquires Master Walter of his companion, &ldquo;or
      is it a lie?&rdquo; His small and well-gloved hand is trembling so, that his
      race-glass gives him views like a kaleidoscope. Splendour or Penury&mdash;nay,
      worse, or Shame await him, and are at the threshold. He knows not yet the
      foot of which it is that draws so nigh; and he dares not look forth to
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not off yet, lad,&rdquo; returned Ralph; and even <i>he</i> has to
      swallow something which appears to be in his throat, but is not, before he
      can give that assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Walter draws a long breath, for this is a reprieve, and endeavours
      once more to fix his eyes upon the dancing horses; but it is the retina of
      the mind only which presents its image. He beholds his mother's face,
      paler and more careworn than ever, sharpened with pain, through something
      which she has learned since&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're off! they're off!&rdquo; is again the cry; and this time the great
      plane of faces shifts and flashes as it follows the speck of colour now in
      rapid motion&mdash;at first, a double line, next a lengthening oval, and
      then a string of brilliants, knotted here and there. As they approach
      Tatten-ham Corner, Walter perceives, for the first time, that they are
      horses, and that three are leading all the rest&mdash;Green, Black, and
      Yellow. The chances are then but two to one against him. How they lag and
      crawl, these vaunted coursers of the air! How long is this frightful
      suspense to last? &ldquo;The Yellow's beat&mdash;<i>Mica</i> is out of it&mdash;the
      Black wins&mdash;the favourite is beaten, blast him!&mdash;<i>Menelaus
      wins</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;There is a thunder of hoofs, a flash of Black and
      Green, then a cry such as, even on Epsom Downs, was never before heard.
      &ldquo;By Heaven, he's off! The boy is killed! Was it short of the post? What
      number's up? The Green has won. <i>The King, The King!</i> Hurrah,
      hurrah!&rdquo; And so the babblement breaks forth again, and the tumultuous
      crowd flows in like water upon the fair green course, save one small space
      of it kept clear by men with staves, where lies a poor whitefaced jockey,
      senseless and motionless, for whose misfortune everybody is sorry, but
      especially those who have backed the Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      All had gone well with the French horse until within a few strides of the
      winning-post; he was leading by half a length, and his victory seemed
      certain to all eyes, when suddenly&mdash;whether through the devilish
      nature of the beast, or whether poor Sam had touched him with the heel in
      that overwhelming crisis, can never now be known&mdash;but he stopped
      stock-still, and shot his rider (snatching at his ear as he flew by) a
      dozen yards like cricket-ball from catapult. The uncelebrated Hicks had
      actually preceded the rival jockey at the post, but left his horse behind
      him; and there the beast was standing yet, with his fore-feet planted
      resolutely before him, and his untwisted ears laid level with his neck, as
      though he was giving &ldquo;a hack&rdquo; at leap-frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down, and let us get away from this, lad,&rdquo; broke forth Derrick
      impatiently: &ldquo;it is no use waiting here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use waiting here,&rdquo; echoed the young man mechanically, as he
      followed his friend through the fast-thinning crowd down to the basement
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the staircase they met Mr Chifney, looking very white and
      disconcerted. He, too, had put more trust than he was wont to place in
      horses in <i>Menelaus</i>, and had suffered in consequence; and the wily
      trainer was not used to losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the boy?&rdquo; inquired Derrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad, sir, bad: it is a bad business altogether,&rdquo; muttered the man of
      horseflesh, not perhaps wholly thinking of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not his fault, however,&rdquo; continued Ralph. &ldquo;No man could have kept
      his seat during such a devil's trick. Look you, let him have all he
      requires; everything. I will be responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chifney had expected from this stormy client some terrible outbreak of
      wrath and disappointment; and lo, he was all benevolence and charity! His
      astonishment exhibited itself significantly enough in his face; but Ralph
      mistook the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stare so, sir? I suppose I am good for a few pounds yet. The
      horse is mine; and I apprehend will be security enough; though I wish I
      could afford to shoot him&mdash;cursed beast! Where is Lord Stonart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Great Personage has, I have heard, just sent for him, to offer his
      congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Derrick uttered a harsh and bitter laugh. &ldquo;I suppose we couldn't see
      this interesting interview, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir,&rdquo; replied the trainer hurriedly, alarmed by Derrick's
      tone and air. &ldquo;I hope you are not thinking of putting us all in the wrong
      by any act of violence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; I thought of conferring the honour of knighthood upon his
      Lordship with a horsewhip&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away,&rdquo; whispered the trainer to Master Walter; &ldquo;for Heaven's
      sake, take him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, home. Come home, Ralph,&rdquo; repeated the young man, like one in a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Lisgard, how goes it?&rdquo; drawled Captain Wobegon, sauntering slowly up
      to where the three were standing. &ldquo;I hope you recouped yourself for last
      night's misfortunes by <i>The King</i> just now. Devilish near thing,
      though. The Frenchman did win by a head, but luckily it was the boy's, and
      not his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I backed the wrong horse,&rdquo; returned Master Walter gloomily. &ldquo;And I owe
      you&mdash;how much is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little over fourteen hundred. If it's any convenience to you, I can
      wait a fortnight or so; I would say longer&mdash;but Lurline&mdash;she was
      inquiring after you, only yesterday, by the by; I felt quite jealous&mdash;has
      a soul above economy. And after the Derby, you know, folks send in their
      bills; especially jewellers. They know if they are not paid <i>then</i>,
      it's a bad look-out. What a lot that fellow Stonart must have netted! I'm
      sorry to see you so down in the mouth; you used to be such a lucky
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used to be such a lucky fellow,&rdquo; mused Master Walter, as he and his
      companion made their way to the outskirts of the heath, where a place had
      been appointed at which their Hansom was to wait for them. &ldquo;Yes, so I was.
      I used to win in a small way, and yet people were always glad to see me.
      They won't be so pleasant, I reckon, when they find that I am a defaulter.
      I can't get at any money for a year, and who 'll wait a year without
      making a row? Even if they do, mine will be a fine coming of age. How <i>could</i>
      I have been such a frightful fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your fortune, my pretty gentleman,&rdquo; observed a gipsy girl, laying
      her walnut-coloured fingers upon the young man's coat-sleeve. &ldquo;You are
      born under a lucky star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have been born there; but I have wandered far away from its
      influence,&rdquo; replied Master Walter, shaking her hand off somewhat roughly.
      &ldquo;If you want a shilling, you shall have it; for I have nothing but other
      people's money about me, and that one always parts with very readily. But
      don't call me lucky, for that's a lie, you jade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your handsome face,&rdquo; returned the gipsy humbly, &ldquo;it's a shame that
      it ever should be crossed by the shadow of sorrow. You can't be unlucky,
      sir, with eyes like yours&mdash;especially,&rdquo; added she, as the two strode
      hastily away, &ldquo;especially among the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear <i>that</i>, lad?&rdquo; laughed Derrick encouragingly; but the
      young man was too wrapt up in his own sombre thoughts to heed such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must sell out,&rdquo; muttered he to himself; &ldquo;that's the first thing. And I
      must run down to Mirk; there is no knowing what that spitfire there may do
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's our Hansom, and the fellow not drunk for a wonder!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Derrick. &ldquo;Where's the horse, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this next booth, sir,&rdquo; returned the driver. &ldquo;I will put him to in no
      time.&mdash;I am afraid your honours have not won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Walter, lad,&rdquo; cried Derrick in remonstrance; &ldquo;that's your fault.
      Don't hang out such signals of distress that everybody who meets us offers
      their confounded pity. Be a man, lad; be a man. Besides, what did that
      gipsy girl say just now? Many a wise word is spoken in jest. She said,
      with your good looks, that you must needs he lucky with the women. I
      should like to see the heiress who would say 'No' to Captain Walter
      Lisgard. A good marriage would mend all this, and&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out of temper, lad,&rdquo; returned the other gravely; &ldquo;but don't say
      those sort of things to me, for I have not deserved them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not deserved them! you have been my ruin, curse you!&rdquo; continued the other
      with vehemence. &ldquo;But for you, you drunken&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take you care, Walter Lisgard!&rdquo; roared the bearded man in a voice of
      thunder. &ldquo;Do not make me strike you, for I would as soon strike my son.
      How can all this be my fault? Do you suppose that I have not lost also&mdash;almost
      all I have in the world save a few hundreds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, mine, I suppose,&rdquo; exclaimed Walter bitterly. &ldquo;I know I owe you a
      thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the other, producing his pocket-book, &ldquo;here are three
      I.O.U.s bearing your signature, for two, three, and five hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be paid, sir, never fear,&rdquo; rejoined the young man insolently.
      &ldquo;No man but you, however, would have produced them at such a time. But it
      serves me right for herding with such people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, young man. At the same time, few of your fine gentlemen would
      treat them this way.&rdquo; Thus saying, he tore them into little strips, and
      scattered them to the wind.&mdash;&ldquo;All I ask, by way of repayment, now is,
      that you will listen to a few words I have to say. I have loved you,
      Walter Lisgard, in spite of yourself, and would have laid down my life for
      yours. I have concealed from my own heart as well as I could the selfish
      baseness that underlies your every act&mdash;but that is over now. Look
      you, on the coasts where I have come from, there is many a bay which, if
      you saw it at high tide, you would say: 'What a beautiful harbour! what
      smooth and smiling water! This is a place for all men to cast anchor.' But
      when the tide is going out, you see how you have been deceived. Here is a
      reef that would wreck a navy; here is a jagged and cruel rock, and there
      another and another. With every one, you say to yourself, surely this is
      the last. But for this and for that, there was never a better anchorage;
      and how beautiful the place is! What luxuriant foliage&mdash;what
      exquisite verdure fringes the shore&mdash;just the shores, you know. But
      when the tide is quite out, it is impossible to like the place any longer.
      There are nothing <i>but</i> reefs and rocks to be seen then, and a few
      loathsome reptiles among the slime. Now, Walter Lisgard, I have come upon
      you at dead low-water, and I don't wish to meet you any more. You will
      deceive others, of course, who may see you at the flow, but you will never
      deceive me. I shall go down to Mirk, after a little, to bring away my
      wife. Take my advice, and don't be there. Above all things, see that your
      mother does not cross me in that matter, or it will be worse for all
      concerned. I have nobody now in the world who cares for me save Mary
      Forest, and they shall not rob me of her. Here is the Hansom in which we
      can no longer sit together. You are not used to walking, being what is
      called a gentleman, so you had better take it. All I ask you is, to leave
      our lodgings before I reach them, since you will arrive there first; or if
      not&mdash;I will take myself off elsewhere; I should be sorry to be under
      the same roof, with you again, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then pulling his hat forward upon his brow, in place of farewell, Ralph
      Derrick turned his back upon Walter Lisgard, and took his way to town on
      foot. As the captain, sitting alone in no very enviable frame of mind,
      passed him afterwards upon the road, he could not help remarking to
      himself how old and bowed the insolent fellow looked.

      CHAPTER VIII. MISS AYNTON'S THUMB IS TURNED BACK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SUPPOSE, Mary,
      that I shall be sure of getting a letter from Mr Arthur today?&rdquo; observed
      my Lady to her maid, as that confidential domestic was proceeding with the
      duties&mdash;which were by no means mysteries&mdash;of her toilet, upon
      the morning after the picnic at Belcomb. He is certain to reply concerning
      a matter which was important enough to cause the use of the telegraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, my Lady: very like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more in contrast than the tones in which these two
      persons had spoken; the question had been earnest, almost fervent, and one
      which evidently was put in order to evoke an affirmative answer; the reply
      was given carelessly enough, or rather as though the thoughts of her who
      uttered it were absent from the matter altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Very likely</i>,' Mary! Why, how can it be otherwise? Just run down
      and open the letter-bag; you know where to find the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mary Forest left the room, she cast at her beloved mistress, whose eyes
      were fixed thoughtfully upon the pattern of the carpet, and observed her
      not, a look of unspeakable love and pity; and when the door was shut
      between them, she burst into a passion of silent tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will kill her,&rdquo; murmured she; &ldquo;she can never survive this second
      trouble. Sorrow and shame, sorrow and shame, are all that fall to my dear
      mistress now. <i>How</i> shall I tell her? May Heaven give her strength to
      bear it; but I wish, for her sake, that she was dead, and already the
      angel she deserves to be&mdash;&mdash;Ah, you minx!&rdquo; ejaculated Mary,
      interrupting herself as she passed Miss Aynton's room, and shaking her
      plump fist at its unconscious tenant; &ldquo;you'll go to quite another place,
      and serve you right too.&rdquo; And seemingly comforted by this reflection, she
      wiped her eyes with the hem of her apron, and hurried down the back-stairs
      upon her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will Arthur think?&rdquo; mused my Lady, as she awaited her maid's return
      with a beating heart. &ldquo;He will certainly connect the request to destroy
      that letter with what I said to him at the Watersmeet a while ago, about&rdquo;&mdash;she
      did not utter the concluding words at all, but only formed them with her
      lips&mdash;&ldquo;poor Ralph. If Arthur suspects, it will be with him the first
      step to knowledge; and yet he would never use it to my hurt. If there were
      anything amiss in the concealment of this matter, then I should fear him,
      for he is the soul of honour. But my bastard son&mdash;God help him, if he
      ever comes to know it&mdash;robs nobody even of this barren title, and my
      children's money is due to no one else. They might have been paupers as
      well as bastards; let their mother comfort herself with that thought all
      she can.&rdquo; My Lady's lips were crooked into a bitter smile: hers was not a
      cynical face&mdash;far from it&mdash;and such an expression misbecame it
      sadly; it looked more like a contortion of the mouth induced by bodily
      pain.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Mary, is there no letter from Mr Arthur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is one more cause for anxiety added to the rest of my
      troubles, that is all. Ah me, how foolishly I used to fret myself in days
      when there was no cause! Perhaps he never got the telegraph, and not
      understanding why the letter came to him, has transmitted it back to&mdash;to
      the person to whom it was addressed.&mdash;Mary, you had better presently
      run over to the <i>Lisgard Arms</i>, and see to that. Steve will give it
      up, if you explain to him that it is your handwriting. Tell him, if
      necessary, that I promise him he shall not lose the inn. I must have that
      letter. Mr Arthur could not possibly know the London address of&mdash;of
      that person, could he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, my Lady, yes&mdash;at least, I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madam,&rdquo; replied the waiting-maid, starting like one
      aroused from a dream. &ldquo;I was not thinking what I said; I was thinking of
      something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might give me your attention, Mary,&rdquo; returned my Lady
      sighing: &ldquo;you cannot be thinking of anything so momentous as this matter,
      which involves sorrow, shame, and perchance utter ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! but I can, my Lady,&rdquo; answered the other gravely; &ldquo;and I am doing
      it. There has something happened worse than anything you can guess at.
      Master Walter&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven! has any accident happened to my boy? I saw him hut an hour
      ago; he came into my room, dear fellow, to bid me good-bye before he
      started for the station. The young horse was in the dog-cart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, Mary, do not&mdash;do not tell me that my Walter is killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is quite well, my Lady, so far as I know&mdash;quite well in health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven for that! Bless you for that, Mary! Why did you frighten me
      so, if there is nothing the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something the matter, my Lady. Pray, command yourself; you will
      have need of all your fortitude. I would never tell it you&mdash;burdened
      as you are already&mdash;only you must know it; <i>you</i>, above all, and
      no one else, if we can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More secrets! more deception, Mary! Spare me, if you can, dear friend; I
      am sorely tried already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot spare you, my Lady, or I would do so, Heaven knows; nay, I would
      almost take the shame upon my own shoulders, if that might shield you from
      the sorrow it must needs bring with it. Miss Letty&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not fit that Shame and my daughter should be mentioned in the same
      breath,&rdquo; replied my Lady, rising, and speaking with dignity. &ldquo;Do not
      continue; I forbid you to speak. What you were going to say is false, and
      I will not listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, my Lady&mdash;true as that the sun is shining now. Of course,
      Miss Letty has nothing to do with it; but it was through her I learned
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she <i>know</i> it, then?&rdquo; asked my Lady sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, madam; and Heaven grant she never may. She's as
      pure-minded as any seraph, and, like Charity, thinketh no evil. But she
      told me this afternoon&mdash;seeing that you were troubled, and not liking
      to pain you, perhaps without reason, and speaking to me as her old nurse
      and friend, who loves all the Lisgards, good and bad (for they are not all
      good, alas, alas!), and who will love them to the end&mdash;she told me
      that something which she had overheard between Miss Rose and Master
      Walter&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Sir Richard,&rdquo; interposed my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam&mdash;his brother. It was Master Walter that I was speaking of
      the other day in the carriage, and whom I understood your Ladyship to say
      that Miss Aynton had refused. I knew very well that they were love-making,
      flirting and such like upon the sly; but I did not know&mdash;I could not
      suspect&mdash;&mdash;- O mistress dear, a terrible disgrace has befallen
      you, through that infamous young hussy, Miss Rose Aynton&mdash;though what
      Master Walter could have seen in the Jade, I am sure passes my
      comprehension altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgrace! Walter! Rose Aynton! What do you mean, woman?&rdquo; asked my Lady
      angrily. &ldquo;You must be mad, to say such things. I heard Sir Richard ask the
      girl to be his wife with my own ears, and she refused him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she, my Lady? Well, I'm surprised at that, for I should have thought
      she would have stuck at <i>nothing</i>.&mdash;But let me tell the whole
      story. What Miss Letty heard at the picnic was this: she heard Master
      Walter cursing Miss Rose. That was an odd thing for a young gentleman to
      do to a young lady&mdash;although, for that matter, I have no doubt she <i>deserved</i>
      it&mdash;was it not? Well, that was what Miss Letty thought. She had never
      heard such words before, and could scarcely force her innocent lips to
      repeat them; but I made her do it. And certainly Master Walter expressed
      himself pretty strong. It seems he was angered about the young woman's
      behaviour to his brother yesterday&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted my Lady quietly, and still thinking that the prejudice
      of her waiting-maid had much exaggerated matters, &ldquo;that was partly my
      fault; I begged Miss Aynton to be more complaisant in her manner to Sir
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Master Walter might have been annoyed, madam, but what right had he
      to be <i>jealous!</i> and especially what relation could exist between him
      and Miss Rose, which justified him in using such dreadful words? Fancy <i>swearing</i>
      at her, my Lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is shocking indeed, Mary. Miss Letty, however, must certainly
      have misunderstood him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I told her, my Lady, in hopes to quiet her a bit; but I did
      not believe it myself, no more than you do. We don't suppose that Miss
      Letty invented the oaths, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; sighed Lady Lisgard. &ldquo;It makes me very wretched to think
      that my boy Walter should have so far forgotten himself as to use such
      language to a young girl&mdash;a guest, too, in his mother's house. I
      shall certainly demand an explanation of it from his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, there is no need, madam,&rdquo; returned the waiting-maid. &ldquo;I can tell
      you all&mdash;if you can bear to listen to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; said my Lady wearily; but she sat with her back towards
      Mistress Forest, and once, in the course of her recital, she uttered a
      piteous moan, and covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Miss Letty told me what I have just said, my Lady, and had parted
      from me a little comforted, trying to persuade herself that she really
      might have been mistaken in what she had overheard, I instantly sought out
      Anne Rees, and bade her come with me to my room. You wouldn't have
      believed it in a girl as you yourself chose out of the village school, and
      who has been at the Abbey under my own eye for four years; but she refused
      point-blank: very respectful, I must say, but also very firm. 'I durstn't
      do it,' said she, all of a twitter&mdash;'not till Miss Rose is abed and
      asleep; or if I do, you may be certain sure as she will come to know it,
      and get out of me every word that may pass between us two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl looked as scared as though she had seen a ghost, and yet my
      request did not seem to come on her at all unexpected; and, in point of
      fact, she knew what she was wanted for well enough. However, I thought it
      best to let her have her way; and so it was arranged that she was to come
      to my room as soon as she had done with the young ladies&mdash;although
      'tis little enough, indeed, she has done for Miss Letty of late weeks, but
      all for that spiteful little hussy, Miss Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now,' said I when I got her alone, 'Anne Rees, there is nobody to listen
      to what we say, and you may speak to me as to your own mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ah, Mistress Forest,' answered she, beginning to whimper,' I only wish I
      dared.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This young lady has got you under her thumb, I see, Annie. Now, if
      you'll tell me the whole truth of what is going on between her and Master
      Walter, I promise you that I'll turn her thumb <i>back</i>. It will hurt
      her a little&mdash;and that you won't be sorry for, perhaps&mdash;and it
      will set you <i>free</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, Mistress Forest, if you could only do <i>that</i>, I would be a good
      girl all my life, and never try on other people's clothes again, nor be a
      spy upon my Lady, and'&mdash;&mdash; Here she stopped quite short, and
      looked as though she would have bitten her tongue off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Anne,' said I, 'you <i>must</i> tell me, whether you will or not:
      for you have gone too far to turn back. How did Miss Rose Aynton make a
      slave of a well-conducted girl like you&mdash;with nothing but vanity,
      that I know of, to be said against you&mdash;and compel you to do all this
      dirty work for her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mistress Forest, as you truly say, I was always a vain child; and
      Heaven has punished me pretty sharp for it. One day, when the young ladies
      were out, and I was in Miss Aynton's room a-setting it to rights, what
      should I come upon&mdash;where, perhaps, I had no right to look for it,
      for it was evidently-meant to be hidden&mdash;but a queer-shaped leather
      box with trinkets in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A jewel-case, I suppose you mean, Anne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, ma'am; but they were none of those as Miss Aynton was in the habit
      of wearing&mdash;nor had she that box when she first came: she must have
      brought it down with her after she went back to London for a week in the
      early part of the year. However, all as struck me then was the beauty of
      the jewels; and I thought there was no harm in my just trying them on in
      the front of the swing mirror. My ears not being pierced, I couldn't fix
      the earrings, although I wouldn't a-minded a little pain, and they
      sparkled like morning-dew; but I clasped on the pearl necklace and the
      bracelets, and stood admiring myself in the looking-glass a good long
      time. Then all of a sudden I saw an angry face looking over my shoulder,
      and heard a cruel voice whisper: &ldquo;Thief, thief!&rdquo; just like the hiss of a
      wood-snake. I scarcely recognised Miss Rose, who had always looked so
      pleasant, and been such a smooth-spoken young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could send you to prison, Anne Eees for this,&rdquo; continued she, very
      grave and slow; &ldquo;and I <i>will</i>, too, if you don't do everything I tell
      you. I hate a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor, miss,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;have mercy, for Heaven's sake! I never meant to
      thieve nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hate a liar,&rdquo; added she, looking so cold and cruel that she made me
      shudder. &ldquo;You break open my drawer&mdash;not a word, you had girl, or I'll
      send to Dalwynch for a policeman&mdash;and I actually find my property on
      your very person! You ought to go to jail for this; and perhaps I am wrong
      not to send you there. However, remember; from this moment, you are <i>my</i>
      servant&mdash;only mine; and whatever I tell you to do, whether it is
      against your late mistress or not, see that you do it; and dare not to
      breathe one word of anything that I do, or speak, or possess&mdash;such as
      these jewels, for instance&mdash;or you will rue it bitterly, Amie Rees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Of course I promised, Mistress Forest, for I was in such a state of
      terror that I would have promised anything; but you cannot imagine to what
      a slavery I bound myself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I know all about that, Anne.' said I: 'everybody knows you're become a
      spy and a sneak. But there is no occasion for you to follow such vocations
      any longer. My Lady would never believe a word of your intending to steal
      those things: I can promise you her protection; so make your mind quite
      easy upon that point.&mdash;But now, what about Master Walter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, Mistress Forest, the jewels were his present, to begin with. There
      have been very wicked goings on. It was quite dreadful to see her kiss
      dear good Miss Letty at night, and return her &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; so pious
      like, when she was not blessing her&mdash;I mean Miss Rose&mdash;at all.
      Oh, Mistress Forest, I have known all this for weeks and weeks, and dared
      not speak one word; and now the truth is almost too terrible to tell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, my Lady,&rdquo; pursued Mistress Forest, &ldquo;she told me things which it
      is not necessary to repeat to you. 'I knew she was telling truth; but in
      order to assure myself that it was so, I crept out with naked feet, and
      listened at Miss Aynton's door, and I heard <i>two</i> voices&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you <i>recognise</i> them, woman; are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked my
      Lady sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, madam&mdash;there is no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help us, and forgive us!&rdquo; murmured my Lady, with bowed head. &ldquo;Ah,
      Walter, Walter, I had expected Shame, but not from deed of yours! Where is
      this&mdash;Miss Aynton, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At her breakfast, my Lady; and doubtless making an exceedingly good one.
      <i>She</i> is not one to let her conscience interfere with her appetite,
      bless you! Like the murderer under sentence in Dalwynch jail, as I read of
      in the paper yesterday, she 'takes her meals with regularity,' I warrant;
      and does not in any way physically deteriorate under the distressing
      circumstances of her situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send her to me, Mary&mdash;in the boudoir yonder,&rdquo; said my Lady gravely.
      &ldquo;Tell her I desire to speak with her very particularly. Breakfast? No,
      alas! I feel as though a morsel of food would choke me. Send her hither at
      once.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THRUST AND COUNTER-THRUST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> CANNOT, for my
      own part, at all agree with the depreciatory expressions used by Mistress
      Forest with respect to Miss Rose Aynton's personal appearance. &ldquo;What
      Master Walter could have seen in her,&rdquo; &amp;c., it was easy enough for
      anybody else to see who was not of her own sex. A magnificent figure,
      masses of silken hair that, when unbound, would ripple almost to her
      dainty feet, and a countenance &ldquo;bright as light, and clear as wind;&rdquo; and
      indeed this latter was too keen and sharply cut for my taste. The sort of
      expression which one likes to see in one's lawyer, does not so well become
      the object of our heart's affections. Of course, there was nothing of
      steel about Miss Rose, except what might have been in her crinoline; but I
      never saw man or woman who gave me so much the idea of being armed <i>cap-à-pied</i>;
      she seemed to be equipped in a complete Milan suit of proof, impregnable,
      invulnerable. Like <i>Le Noir Fainéant</i> in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, she never
      attacked anybody, although my Lady fancied she had recently detected signs
      of aggression about her; and those who knew her best avoided putting the
      temptation in her way. But when she entered her hostess's boudoir by
      invitation, upon that particular morning, she looked not only, as usual,
      on her guard; there was also a certain slumbrous fire in her dark eyes,
      which betokened onslaught&mdash;the initiative of battle. My Lady herself
      remarked it, not without pity. &ldquo;How little is this poor lost creature
      aware,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;that I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was quite wrong in this. Miss Rose had almost gathered the truth
      from the trembling fingers and frightened manner of her tiring-maid that
      morning; and the thing had been quite confirmed to her by the malicious
      triumph with which Mary Forest had delivered her mistress's request to see
      her in the boudoir upon very particular business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please to sit down, Miss Aynton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was so. The secret was out. Not even a morning salutation from her
      friend and hostess; and the hand only outstretched to point her out a
      chair at the other extremity of the room. &ldquo;Before proceeding with what I
      have to say,&rdquo; began my Lady, &ldquo;I wish to know whether your aunt is in
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, Lady Lisgard; I think she has come back from Leamington&mdash;although
      I have not heard from her for the last two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. When I hinted, yesterday morning, that it would be better
      for you to return to London, I was unaware of the <i>necessity</i> for
      your departure from this roof at once&mdash;<i>immediately</i>&mdash;and
      for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Not a muscle moved: confident in the goodness, if not of her
      cause, at least of her Milan suit; conscious, too, of the possession of a
      Damascus poniard, undreamed of by the foe, and admirable for close
      encounters, her right hand nervously opened and shut as though to clutch
      the handle&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have disgraced this house and me: yourself and your sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, insolent woman,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;<i>and judge others by
      yourself</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each started to her feet, and looked her enemy in the face as she slung
      these words of flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worse than useless, girl, thus to brazen it out,&rdquo; continued my
      Lady, attaching no importance to the emphasis the other laid upon her last
      words. &ldquo;Outraging not only moral laws, but even the rites of hospitality,
      you have intrigued with my own son under my own roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare to say so, Lady Lisgard, do you? It is only for his sake, I
      swear, that I do not brand <i>you</i> Wanton, for that calumny. I <i>could</i>
      do it; you know I could, although you wear that look of wonder. Was not
      that man Derrick once your lover? Ah! you wince at that. Sir Robert&mdash;good,
      easy man&mdash;he knew nothing, of course&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she stopped, for my Lady's face was terrible to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, bad, bold girl! You shoot your poisoned arrows at a venture,
      and aim nothing home. You know not what a wife should be&mdash;how should
      you? You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not true that the swan is &ldquo;born to be the only graceful shape of
      Scorn.&rdquo; A fair woman unjustly slandered is its rival therein. Rose Aynton
      cowered before that keen contempt&mdash;beneath the dropping of those
      bitter words&mdash;-as though they were sword and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never forgive you this, Lady Lisgard,&rdquo; muttered she&mdash;&ldquo;never,
      never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You! you</i> forgive! To such as you, it would be idle to protest my
      soul is spotless. The man whose name you have soiled by uttering it&mdash;my
      husband&mdash;he, in high heaven, knows right well that never so much as
      thought of mine has wronged him. Vile, evil-minded girl, as false as
      frail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sufficient, madam; almost enough, even if I were indeed the thing
      you take me for.&rdquo; Here the girl paused to moisten her dry lips, and catch
      her breath, of which passion had almost deprived her. &ldquo;Now, look you, I
      was wrong. I thought my Lady was not so lily-pure as the world took her to
      be, and I was wrong. I have seen things with my own eyes, and through the
      eyes of others, that might well entitle me to say: 'I still believe it,' I
      tell you, Lady Lisgard, I have <i>proofs</i>&mdash;or what seemed to me to
      be so, a few minutes back&mdash;of the charge that has so moved you, such
      as would amply justify my disbelief in your denial. But I honestly avow
      that I was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Miss Rose Aynton, for your charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare your scorn, madam. It is no charity that moves me; nay, far from
      it. Convinced almost against my will, I own, by your unsupported assertion&mdash;your
      mère 'No,' I have withdrawn an accusation for which I have been patiently
      preparing evidence this long time&mdash;not, indeed, for your hurt, but
      for my own safety and convenience, and hereby confess it baseless and
      unjust. Now, on your part, I do beseech you, make amends to <i>me</i>.
      You, too, have had your seeming proofs of my disgrace; you, too, have
      heard and seen yourself, or through the eyes and ears of others, certain&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add not, lost, wretched girl,&rdquo; interposed my Lady, &ldquo;deceit to sin! All
      that is left you is to pray to Heaven for pardon, and to leave that
      hospitable roof which you have disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose Aynton's gipsy face grew drawn and pale. She had aimed her blow, and
      missed; the weapon in which she had put so much trust had proved utterly
      good for nothing. All her schemes of the last few months were rendered
      fruitless, and the discoveries to which she had attached such vast
      importance, and which she had attained to by such mean arts, shewn to be
      vain and futile. And now that she had humiliated herself by owning this,
      and thrown herself at this woman's feet, she would not extend so much as a
      finger-tip to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lisgard, as I hope for heaven,&rdquo; cried she in anguish, &ldquo;I am innocent
      of that with which you charge me; I am honest as yourself, or Letty. Alas,
      you shudder, because I dare to compare myself with your pure daughter; you
      think that I soil that name, too, by uttering it. What shall I say&mdash;by
      what shall I swear, in order to make you believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would to Heaven I <i>could</i> believe you, Rose,&rdquo; returned my Lady
      sadly, touched in spite of herself by the girl's yearning appeal. &ldquo;If you
      could erase this damning blot upon my son's fair name, and give me back my
      Walter&mdash;as I deemed him but an hour ago&mdash;I would be so grateful,
      girl, that you should almost think I loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>would!</i>&rdquo; cried Rose with eagerness; then added bitterly: &ldquo;But
      no; you mean if I could say: 'Your son has never pressed his lips to
      these, has never sworn to be mine, and mine alone.' But you would not
      thank me for merely proving that in this, although he did it, he was not
      to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Not to blame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam&mdash;for even for <i>his</i> sake, I cannot longer bear this
      burden of undeserved shame. <i>Walter Lisgard is my husband</i>. We were
      married weeks ago, when I went to London in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, married!&rdquo; gasped my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that! Far better to deceive <i>me</i>, boy, than this poor
      girl. I never thought to say: 'I am glad you are my daughter-in-law, Rose
      Aynton;' but I do say so now.&rdquo; She took both her hands in hers, and gazed
      upon her downcast face, now overspread with blushes, and tinged for once
      with genuine tenderness. &ldquo;It moves you, does it, that I am thankful to see
      the honour of my son preserved at some sacrifice of his prospects. How
      little do you know me, girl! yet I am glad to move you anyway. Rose, be a
      kind wife to him. I will not blame you for what has happened, although I
      have much cause. I must blame <i>him</i> rather. Who can wonder that you
      yielded when he said: 'Be mine.' So gentle and so loving as he can be!
      Now, too, I see it all. When you refused Sir Richard in the library, you
      were actually his brother's wife. Ah, Heaven, you must not remain here
      longer&mdash;not a day. I shall write to Walter&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam&mdash;<i>mother</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Rose beseechingly, &ldquo;I pray you
      let <i>me</i> write. I have broken my plighted word, and disobeyed my
      husband's bidding in revealing this. To please him, I had resolved to
      defend myself this morning as I best might, by returning thrust for
      thrust, without using this shield&mdash;my innocence&mdash;at all. But
      your bitter words&mdash;a shower of barbed darts&mdash;drove me behind it.
      He will be very wrath with me indeed, madam; but far worse if the news
      comes from you. He has much just now to make him anxious too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied my Lady hastily. &ldquo;How is it, then, that I have heard
      nothing of it? But I forgot; it is <i>you</i> who have his secrets now.
      Yes, you shall write, not I. Tell him that I am sorry&mdash;sorry that he
      should have deceived me above all; but that I forgive him freely. He knows
      that, however, right well. He must not come back to Mirk until he hears
      from me; and you, Rose, you must join him without delay. Every member of
      this household must learn at once that you are Walter's wife; but not till
      you have gone&mdash;for Richard's sake.&rdquo; My Lady's thoughts, as always,
      were for others; even when this great blow had well-nigh stunned her, she
      did not permit herself the luxury of selfish grief. She was already busy
      with schemes for the benefit of her erring boy; how to contrive and where
      to save without prejudice to Sir Richard's interests (for <i>that</i> must
      be now avoided above everything) so that a respectable allowance might be
      meted out to the young couple. She could not respect, and far less love
      the girl who had become her Walter's wife in so clandestine a manner; but
      still she <i>was</i> his wife, and therefore, in her eyes, a something
      precious. Then, bad as matters were, they might have been far worse; she
      had fully expected that they were so; and she felt in some sort grateful
      to accept this product of rashness and deceit in place of downright shame.
      Moreover, she foresaw in her own mind, for ever dwelling on such
      contingencies, that out of this evil a certain good might come, in case of
      that terrible misfortune befalling her, compared with which this present
      sorrow was as the prick of a pin's point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, upon her part, had certainly cause for congratulation upon the
      result of this interview. Although her weapon of offence had failed her&mdash;and
      she was genuinely convinced of the groundlessness of her late suspicions
      concerning Lady Lisgard&mdash;she had found in her mother-in-law a most
      generous adversary, and one certainly far more forgiving than she
      deserved. Even the worst of us, I conclude, are not bad at all times, and
      when my Lady, as they parted, touched her brow with her pale lips, and
      murmured once more: &ldquo;Be a kind wife to him, Rose,&rdquo; that young woman
      mustered an honest tear or two&mdash;of which articles, to do her justice,
      she did not keep, like some women, a constant supply on hand for social
      emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until she regained her own room did she begin to think that she had
      been unnecessarily humble, and had weakly suffered herself to be moved by
      the show of forgiveness and good-will which my Lady had doubtless put on
      for her own purposes. However, the confession had been made, and upon the
      whole, most satisfactorily got over, the thought of which had oppressed
      her of late more than she cared to own, and made her bitter against her
      mother-in-law, as people generally feel towards those whom they are
      conscious of having wronged. And now there was that letter to write to
      Walter, which we have seen him peruse with such disfavour at his hotel in
      Town, acquainting him with her premature avowal of their common secret;
      and many a line of dexterous excuse she wove, and many a line of
      affectionate pleading, only to be torn up and recomposed again and again;
      for there was one person in the world beside herself whom Rose loved
      dearly, and yet of whom she stood in deepest awe; and he whom she both
      loved and feared with all the strength of her energetic nature, was her
      husband&mdash;Walter Lisgard.

      CHAPTER X. NO LETTERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>PON the morning
      after the interview between Rose and Lady Lisgard, the latter again sent
      down Mistress Forest for the post-bag, and was once more disappointed at
      receiving no news from Arthur Haldane; not only did the interval of
      twenty-four hours make this matter additionally serious, and increase her
      former apprehensions that he had not received her telegram, and might find
      some means of forwarding Derrick's letter to himself&mdash;since it had
      certainly not come back to the <i>Lisgard Arms</i>; but there was a still
      graver cause for anxiety in the fact that Mary Forest also received no
      reply from Ralph to that rejection so decidedly yet courteously composed
      by her mistress, with the view of taking away all hope, and at the same
      time of leaving as little sting of anger as was possible. Lady Lisgard
      would have almost preferred to have received from this man a declaration
      of open warfare&mdash;an expressed resolution of carrying away Mary as his
      wife, in spite of all obstacles&mdash;rather than this menacing No Answer.
      Contemptuous silence was not at all the natural line for one of his
      violent character to take, if he had decided to treat her waiting-woman's
      letter as final. He was more likely in that case to have penned a tornado
      of invective, and bidden both mistress and maid to have gone to the devil.
      It seemed only too probable, then, that he was determined&mdash;as he had
      threatened&mdash;to take no denial; and that he would return in person,
      sooner or later, to Mirk, to prosecute his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lady made certain preparations for that extremity&mdash;nay, for the
      worst that could possibly arise&mdash;chief among which was
      the-composition of a very long and carefully-conned epistle to her eldest
      son, that she put by in her desk undated and unsealed, so that additions
      could be made to it at pleasure. Then she waited in agonies of suspense
      day after day; and yet no letter came for her maid from Ralph, or for
      herself from Arthur Haldane. Moreover, although, in her absorbing anxiety
      about the more serious subject, this affected my Lady far less than it did
      Rose, no communication came from Walter in answer to her long and
      justificatory letter, acquainting him with the disclosure of their
      marriage. Our readers are aware that this last circumstance was simply due
      to the fact, that it was reposing in the &ldquo;address-box&rdquo; of the <i>Turf
      Hotel</i>, until such time as it caught the eye of the overworked waiter,
      and was carried over with apologies to Walter's lodgings, whither he had
      given orders that anything addressed to him should be conveyed forthwith.
      But he had not particularly expected a letter from that quarter&mdash;or,
      at all events, felt very anxious to get it&mdash;for nobody but Rose would
      have written to him to the <i>Turf Hotel</i>, all others at Mirk and
      elsewhere believing him to be at Canterbury with his regiment, whence all
      communications were forwarded to him to his London lodgings. Thus, from
      the very deceit to which she had lent herself&mdash;to her peculiar
      information as to his movements&mdash;was this failure of Rose's letter to
      reach her husband owing. During this protracted interval, she suffered
      agonies of suspense, of mortification, and even of fear. It was wormwood
      to have to say to her mother-in-law every morning: &ldquo;He has not written
      yet,&rdquo; and thereby to confess that Walter treated with indifference the
      embarrassing position in which she was now placed at Mirk Abbey; moreover,
      she surmised that her husband was too much enraged with her disobedience
      in betraying their secret, to write at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife knew&mdash;although few others did&mdash;that Master Walter was
      capable of being &ldquo;put out&rdquo; to a very considerable! extent. His very
      marriage with herself&mdash;although she fortunately did not know <i>that</i>&mdash;had
      been mainly owing to his impatience of opposition, and pique against his
      elder brother. Doubtless propinquity and opportunities of flirtation with
      a beautiful and accomplished girl, not by any means lavish of her smiles,
      but whose devotion to himself had been almost that of a slave for her
      master, had carried the handsome captain towards the gulf of matrimony;
      but it was the desire to thwart Sir Richard&mdash;who, his jealous eye
      perceived, was falling seriously in love with Rose long before <i>she</i>
      saw it&mdash;which was the final cause of his rash act. He eagerly
      snatched at an occasion at once of self-gratification, and of humiliating
      his proud and arrogant brother. He was delighted to let him know that
      neither his wealth nor his title could weigh in the balance of a woman's
      favour against the gifts and graces which it was his habit to depreciate
      or ignore. We have said that he discovered Sir Richard's passion even
      before the object of it; but Rose's subtle brain was already preoccupied
      with himself. To give that scheming beauty her due, I think that even had
      she not been already Walter's wife, she would not have exchanged him for
      the baronet, at the period when he made her that dazzling offer in the
      Library. She felt that she had let slip a splendid prize, and was
      proportionally angry with Sir Richard, whose backwardness and hauteur had
      prevented her from recognising the possibility of its falling to her lot;
      but the feeling of disappointment was but transient; she was a bride of
      only a few weeks, and to get disenchanted of one like Walter Lisgard is a
      long process even for a wife. By this time, however, though she idolised
      him, still Rose had learned to fear him; and absolutely dared not pen
      another letter to inquire the reason of his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those who waited, sick at heart, for the coming of the postman every
      morning, Lady Lisgard, therefore, was the first to lose patience. She
      wrote to Arthur Haldane a few urgent lines, requesting his immediate
      presence at Mirk &ldquo;upon private and particular business and within an hour
      of their receipt he took the train, and appeared in person at the Abbey.
      My Lady had decided to consult him, in preference to his father,
      respecting the arrangements necessary to be made for the future
      maintenance of Walter and his wife, since it would be very unwise to make
      so much importance of the matter concerning Derrick, about which she was
      in reality vastly more concerned, and burned to know the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, <i>ma mère!</i>&rdquo; inquired he tenderly, when, not
      without the exercise of some address&mdash;for Sir Richard was always
      hospitable, and (especially in the absence of his brother) both gracious
      and attentive to all guests&mdash;Arthur and my Lady had managed to get an
      hour to themselves in the boudoir. &ldquo;You look very pale and anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Arthur, I have enough to make me so. Walter has secretly made Rose
      Aynton his wife. Ah! you pity me, I see, and perhaps him also. Do not
      condole with me, however. I have sent for you hither to help me to make
      the best&mdash;&mdash;-Alas, alas, you would not have believed it of my
      Walter, would you?&rdquo; And my Lady, touched by the sympathising look and
      manner of the honest young fellow, burst into the first &ldquo;good cry&rdquo; which
      she had permitted to herself since the calamity had been discovered; for
      when confiding the circumstance to Letty, it had been her duty to bear up,
      and when alone, a still more serious anxiety consumed her. Even now, her
      emotion, though violent, was soon over, and the indulgence in it seemed to
      have done her good. &ldquo;Pardon me, Arthur,&rdquo; said she, with one of her old
      smiles; &ldquo;I won't be foolish any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, after narrating matters with which we are acquainted, she laid
      before him, as concisely as she could, what funds at her own disposal
      could be made available to form an income for the young couple, in
      addition to the interest which Walter's fortune of five thousand pounds or
      so, into the possession of which he would come in some eighteen months,
      would yield. She little knew that on that very night&mdash;for it was the
      eve of the Derby Day&mdash;the unworthy boy, for whom she was making such
      sacrifices, was about to risk and lose more than a third of his patrimony,
      and that upon the next day the remainder was doomed to go, and much more
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this will pinch you, <i>ma mere</i>,&rdquo; reasoned Arthur kindly, &ldquo;and
      narrow your own already somewhat scanty revenue sadly. Sir Richard will
      come into a very fine rent-roll in June, beside thousands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can we ask him to help Walter and <i>his wife?</i> And could Walter
      take it, even if his brother were generous enough to offer it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard is quite capable of such magnanimity, <i>ma mere</i>, unless
      I am much mistaken in his character. He would not like to see his brother&mdash;even
      were he but a Lisgard, let alone his so near kith and kin&mdash;in a
      position that would be discreditable to the family; while if one has
      really loved a woman, one surely does not wish to see her poor and
      struggling, simply because she has preferred some one else. As for
      Walter's accepting the help which his brother can so well spare&mdash;it
      may be a little bitter&mdash;but, in my opinion, that would be far
      preferable to receiving what would impoverish his mother. The arrangements
      you propose would leave you but three hundred pounds a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered my Lady hastily, &ldquo;I require that for a purpose, else half
      the sum would easily suffice my present needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would do nothing of the sort, <i>ma mère</i>. Come, let us be
      reasonable. If you will leave this matter in my hands, I will endeavour to
      be the mediator between your sons. Sir Richard has an honest regard for
      me, I think, and Walter also, when he is himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Walter!&rdquo; murmured my Lady sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is to be pitied,&rdquo; answered the other drily; &ldquo;but also, between
      ourselves&mdash;although I shall endeavour, after my lawyer instincts, to
      make it appear otherwise to his brother&mdash;to be somewhat blamed, <i>ma
      mère</i>. Since, then, I am prepared, under the cloak of arbitrator, to be
      the partisan of your darling&mdash;&mdash;Yes, they are both your
      darlings, Lady Lisgard, I know, but with a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter is in trouble,&rdquo; urged my Lady pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the reason, of course. However, will you put the case
      unreservedly in my own hands? for if so, although it is not an easy task,
      I will do my best to make your sons shake hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none like you, Arthur, none. Heaven bless you and reward you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be none like me, <i>ma mere</i>, but there are also, I hope,
      many people a great deal better. And now that we have done with this
      matter for the present, may I ask, Why letters are directed to another
      person, under care to me, which I am at the same time directed by telegram
      to put behind the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you got that telegram, did you?&rdquo; said my Lady quietly. &ldquo;Mary Forest
      entreated me so to send it. The fact was, she accepted that person by
      letter&mdash;-what was his name?&mdash;of whom we spoke together some time
      ago at the Watersmeet; but afterwards, persuaded by me (acting in
      accordance with your suggestion, you remember), she decided to refuse him.
      But the first letter was unfortunately posted before the second was
      written; and the postmistress at Dalwynch positively refused to give it
      up, although I drove over there myself to request it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my life, <i>ma mère</i>, but you're a bold woman,&rdquo; exclaimed
      the young lawyer laughing. &ldquo;Why, of course, she wouldn't give it up. She
      would be stealing the property of the Postmaster-general if she had done
      so, and you would be the receiver with the guiltiest knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at all events, she did not,&rdquo; pursued my Lady simply. &ldquo;She would do
      nothing beyond directing the envelope afresh to your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest creature!&rdquo; interrupted Arthur grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under these circumstances, I telegraphed to you, knowing that you would
      be good enough to destroy the letter directly it reached you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>ma mere</i>, and I did so,&rdquo; returned Arthur gravely; &ldquo;but I
      feared it was not right, and now that you have told me this, I know that
      it was wrong. You may have had your reasons, dear Lady Lisgard, and
      doubtless very urgent ones, to wish the destruction of those letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those letters!&rdquo; exclaimed my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am certain, of course, that you intended no harm to any one, and
      that what you did was in ignorance of the law; but so suspicious was I of
      your having transgressed it&mdash;and at the same time, perhaps, a little
      annoyed that you should have chosen <i>me</i>, Lady Lisgard, for your
      instrument in such a matter&mdash;that I purposely omitted to communicate
      with you, to put in writing any evidence whatsoever of that transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said my Lady hastily, and taking no notice of the young man's
      evident annoyance. &ldquo;But you speak of <i>letters</i>. There was only <i>one</i>
      letter directed to Pump Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were two, Lady Lisgard, and both addressed in the same handwriting.
      The words, <i>Turf Hotel, Piccadilly</i>, were crossed out also, in each
      case, I remember, in red ink. It was the postmistress who did it, I have
      no doubt. If you led her to imagine that that was the wrong address in the
      one instance, she naturally imagined it to be so in the other, and
      probably made the alteration in all good faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven, and so it must have been!&rdquo; exclaimed my Lady, clasping her
      hands. &ldquo;O Arthur, this mischance&mdash;if my misconduct does indeed
      deserve punishment, has brought, I fear, a very harsh and bitter one&mdash;that
      is on Mary. The second letter should have reached the person to whom it
      was addressed without fail. He will now have heard nothing&mdash;this
      Derrick; and he will take the woman's silence for consent. O Arthur,
      Arthur, you little know what bad news this is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see, <i>ma mère</i>, that it vexes you,&rdquo; answered the young man
      kindly; &ldquo;and that is evil enough for me to know. Some sorrows are best
      kept to one's self, I think. Now, look you, this Mr Derrick will
      certainly, being a sporting-man, be in town to-morrow night. He will not
      have left his hotel before the Derby is over. Now, I will go and seek him
      out to-morrow with the letter in my hand that Mary shall re-write. We have
      only but a very little time, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Arthur, counsellor, and friend, and son in one, what comfort do you
      not give me in all straits!&rdquo; She rose and offered him her pale but comely
      cheek, which the young man touched with reverent lips; then holding her
      hand in his, he said in a firm voice: &ldquo;And now, <i>ma mère</i>, even that
      is not fee enough for such an avaricious lawyer as I am. I have promised
      myself a talk with Letty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, and Heaven bless you, my dear boy&mdash;ay, bless you both,&rdquo;
       continued my Lady, when he had left the room, &ldquo;for you would take her for
      your wife even though you knew what I know of her unhappy birth. I have
      almost a mind to tell him; but then, with his stern notions of what is
      right&mdash;although, Heaven knows, I wrong no one by this reticence&mdash;he
      might&mdash;&mdash; 'Some sorrows are best kept to one's self, I think,'
      said he. And whether he suspects something amiss, and meant the words for
      my particular ear or not, it is sound advice. Sufficient for the day is
      the evil thereof. If I were always to be thinking of the morrow, I should
      soon go mad.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. MR ARTHUR HALDANE MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OME writers are
      very fond of describing interviews between betrothed persons, and there
      are undoubtedly readers who take a pleasure in reading such delicate
      details; and yet it seems strange that this should be so, with respect to
      the mère description of what in real life is undoubtedly tame and stupid
      to the looker-on; for what can be duller, or more uninteresting, except to
      one another, than &ldquo;an engaged couple.&rdquo; With what meaningless emphasis they
      smile; what mysterious secrets (known to every adult in the company) they
      interchange; and how they go blindly feeling after one another's hands
      under the table, whenever the opportunity offers. I think it even profane
      to mention such tender mysteries. Arthur Haldane and Letty Lisgard were
      not indeed a betrothed couple when they met upon the present occasion, but
      they became so before they parted. Their subject of conversation being the
      marriage of somebody else, it naturally enough strayed to their own. &ldquo;I am
      not a good match for you, Letty, just at present,&rdquo; said the young man
      frankly, during a lucid interval, &ldquo;but I do not despair of removing the
      disparity of fortune. I am getting on in my profession better than I could
      have hoped for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why 'disparity' of any sort, dear Arthur, should affect
      persons who really love one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my own sweet Letty,&rdquo; replied the other (relapsing). &ldquo;But then your
      family&mdash;no exertions of mine can procure for me such a pedigree as
      you can boast of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter of genuine congratulation, Arthur. Dear Richard often
      makes me wish that there were no such things as ancestors. I suppose it is
      a dreadful heresy, but it seems to me so strange that people are not taken
      for what they <i>are</i> let their birth be what it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Rose of Radicals!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man with admiration; &ldquo;your
      words deserve to be written in letters of gold.&rdquo; And so saying, he took
      out his pocket-book, and, in spite of her opposition, transcribed them
      then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what possible good can <i>that</i> be, you dear foolish fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say for certain, Letty,&rdquo; answered he gravely. &ldquo;But keep a thing
      long enough, and its use will come, folks say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arthur Haldane had, as we are aware, some other interviews awaiting
      him, less agreeable than the one on hand, which perhaps may account for
      his prolonging it to an inordinate length. There was no difference of
      opinion expressed in this one; and what is unusual in arguments between
      the sexes, the lady had not the last word at parting. Strictly speaking,
      neither had it. The farewell of each expired almost at the same instant,
      and was not breathed into the <i>ear</i> at all: I say &ldquo;almost&rdquo; advisedly,
      and from a desire to be accurate, for if each imprints a kiss upon the
      other's <i>cheek</i>, they cannot do it quite coincidently; and it is
      certain, if the statistics of the matter could be collected, that nine
      engaged couples (for, of course, no couple does it who are <i>not</i>
      engaged) out of every ten do salute one another in that way, and not press
      &ldquo;lip to lip,&rdquo; as the poets make out; in fact, it requires a particular and
      uniform conformation of nose&mdash;both must be &ldquo;snubs&rdquo;&mdash;to render
      the thing practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard, whom we have been compelled occasionally to represent in an
      unfavourable light, did not fall short, in his interview with Arthur
      Haldane, of the high estimate which the latter had formed of his chivalric
      nature; or perhaps it was through his overweening pride, that could not
      permit the woman upon whom his affections had once condescended to rest,
      to be inconvenienced by narrow circumstances; but, actuated by whatever
      motive, his behaviour towards the rash young couple was liberal in the
      extreme. He accepted very willingly the explanation, given by the young
      lawyer with great tact, of his refusal by Rose Aynton. No utterance was
      given to the remark, that if he had pressed his suit a little earlier,
      doubtless no thought of his younger brother would have entered the girl's
      brain; but the suggestion was, somehow or other, delicately conveyed, and
      in that Gilead there was balm. Strange as it may appear, the object of his
      rejected suit seemed to have won forgiveness not only for herself, but for
      her husband, to whose faults he had heretofore shewn himself so
      unfraternally alive. He certainty did not request Arthur to offer his
      congratulations to the young Benedict; but he sent by him a conciliatory
      message, and a special request that Captain and Mrs Lisgard would not fail
      to visit the Abbey upon the occasion of the approaching <i>fête</i>. The
      period of his own coming of age would be a very fitting one for the
      newly-married pair to introduce themselves to the people of the country,
      while their presence at such a time would evidence that there was no
      family breach. In all this, there was doubtless a leaven of selfishness;
      but there was considerable magnanimity also, and the manner in which the
      baronet spoke of Rose herself would have done honour to Bayard. In this
      matter, it must be even conceded that he shewed more nobility of spirit
      than the ladies of his household. His mother had forgiven the girl, after
      a fashion, it is true; but her feelings towards her were anything but
      genial. One's heart cannot be made to yearn towards a sly and deceitful
      young person, just because she happens to be one's daughter-in-law. Her
      pity for Walter was great, but it did not beget Love for <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Letty, again, Rose stood even lower, or perhaps seemed to do so, from
      the higher eminence which she had previously occupied in the affections of
      her school-friend. A young lady who has sworn an eternal friendship, does
      not relish the discovery that the other party to that solemn transaction
      has been making a fool of her under her own roof for months; nay, has been
      systematically deceiving her upon a matter mutual confidences concerning
      which form the very basis of such compacts&mdash;namely, the Beloved
      Object. Young men do not encourage one another to communicate their honest
      love-secrets, although some are boastful enough of their conquests over
      the sex, where there is no pretence of the heart being concerned; but with
      young ladies, this sort of information is the most prized of all. There is
      a tacit, if not an expressed understanding between female friends, that
      the first genuine &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; formed by either shall at once be revealed
      to the other. The expectation of that tender avowal is what is uppermost
      in their minds whenever they meet; and when it <i>has</i> been made, what
      an endless subject of sympathy does the unconscious swain become between
      these devoted young persons! How the qualities of his mind are canvassed,
      and the colour of his hair; how his religious principles are eulogised,
      and also his small feet; and how, in short, the Betrothed and her faithful
      Confidante construct a mental and physical ideal for Jones, out of what
      they have read of the Admirable Crichton and the Apollo Belvedere. Betty
      Lisgard was as good a girl&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;as ever drew breath;
      but she was human, and when she kissed Rose the first time after she
      learned she had become her sister, it was by no means the impassioned
      salute which it had used to be, nor had her &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; although delivered
      with emphasis, at all the genuine ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the other females at the Abbey, it was fortunate for Rose that she
      had not to apply to <i>them</i> for a character; for although Mistress
      Forest knew her place better than to circulate scandal, Miss Anne Rees, no
      longer restrained by terror of the constabulary, indemnified herself for
      previous reticence, by favouring her fellow-servants with some very
      curious details indeed with respect to Mrs Walter Lisgard. My Lady's
      proposal, that Rose should take advantage of Mr Arthur Haldane's escort on
      the morrow to her aunt's house, until she should receive her husband's
      directions as to her future place of abode, was, I think, very generally
      welcomed, and felt to be a relief by the whole house.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long railway journey to town, however, she made herself
      agreeable enough to her companion, as she was well able to do, when so
      disposed, to all his sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young barrister was prudent and sagacious beyond his years, and what
      he knew of the lady's behaviour, did not certainly prepossess him in her
      favour; but, nevertheless, he was obliged to confess to himself (although
      he omitted to do so to Letty) that Mrs Walter Lisgard was a very charming
      person. It is undeniable that a married woman may make herself twice as
      pleasant, for any short interval, like a railway journey, as any single
      one can do; she is not afraid of being considered too forward, or of
      laying herself out to captivate; while, if you are a bachelor with whose
      <i>tendresse</i> for any fair one she is acquainted, she will take you
      under her patronage, notwithstanding that you may be twice her age, and so
      sympathise with you, and identify herself with your absent intended, that
      you are half inclined to squeeze her hand, and cover it with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arthur Haldane had much too judicial a mind to give way to any impulse
      of that kind, but it was very nice to hear Rose eulogise her &ldquo;darling
      Letty,&rdquo; and protest that the man who married her would find himself united
      with an angel. He quite forgot, under this soothing treatment, that his
      impression on leaving the Abbey was, that the two young ladies were not
      very good friends; nor did it occur to him at all that this privilege of
      matronly talk was being exercised by a bride not two months wedded, and
      whose surreptitious marriage had only been discovered about a week ago.
      When they had reached London, and were approaching her aunt's residence in
      the late afternoon, they found themselves suddenly in a broad stream of
      vehicles, for the most part furnished with four horses, but very unlike
      the usual spick-and-span London equipages, being covered with white dust,
      and bearing traces of recent rapid travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> quite forgot it was the Derby Day,&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur: &ldquo;these are
      the gentlemen of the road, and I daresay your husband is among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose turned quite pale, and leaning back in the cab, did not again look
      out of window until they arrived at her aunt's door, where the two
      companions parted very good friends indeed. Rose gave a little sigh as she
      thanked him for his escort, which went&mdash;not indeed to the young man's
      heart, but a good way too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Master Walter does not ill-treat that poor girl,&rdquo; soliloquised
      Arthur as he drove away; &ldquo;but I am almost certain that she s afraid of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      London after the Derby is more like Pandemonium even than on the night
      before; the winners are wild with joy, and inclined for any sort of
      dissipation; the losers also crave for the Circean cup, that they may
      temporarily forget their misfortunes. With the unusual roar of wheel and
      hoof in the streets, there mixes a still more unusual shouting; and from
      the open windows of places of entertainment, there streams forth the
      tangled talk which is confined within doors at other times. Before Arthur
      could reach the <i>Turf Hotel</i>, he learned from these sources, without
      further inquiry, that <i>The King</i> had won the race, in consequence of
      some mischance having happened to the jockey of <i>Menelaus</i>. He knew,
      therefore, that Walter Lisgard had lost money. Still, when upon reaching
      his lodging he first set eyes upon the young dragoon, moodily stretched
      upon the sofa, with eyes staring straight before him, and a face as pale
      as the tablecloth, on which stood an untasted meal, he was astonished and
      shocked. For the moment&mdash;such a rigidity was there about those
      exquisite features&mdash;Arthur thought with a shudder that he was dead.
      Even after he entered the room, lit only from the glaring street, not a
      limb stirred, not a muscle moved to mark any consciousness of his
      presence; but when he exclaimed: &ldquo;Walter! what's the matter, man?&rdquo; the
      figure leapt up with a cry of pleasure, and took both his hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, Arthur,&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very kind of you, and I do not deserve it. I thought it was that
      infernal scoundrel Derrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he may have come and gone, for all I know, for I believe I have been
      in a sort of nightmare; only it was a horse that caused it. Derrick's
      partner&mdash;or Derrick himself, for what I know&mdash;sold the race. I
      know what you are going to say, that you always told me how it would be&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Walter,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur kindly. &ldquo;I am not come hither to
      reproach you. I am only the bearer of good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear some of that,&rdquo; said the other bitterly. &ldquo;Where is
      it? Have you brought a loaded pistol with you? That would be the most
      friendly action you could do me just now, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter, you should not talk like that,&rdquo; answered Arthur very gravely, for
      there was a look in his friend's eyes which seemed to harmonise only too
      well with his despairing words. &ldquo;When we kill ourselves so
      philosophically, we forget how we wound others by that selfish act. Think
      of your mother, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She would be sorry, would she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would break her heart, Walter; that's all. And besides, you have a
      wife now&mdash;yes, we all know it, and you're both forgiven&mdash;and why
      you have not written to her in answer to the letter she wrote you, none of
      us can imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only got it this very day,&rdquo; groaned Walter. &ldquo;Am I in a fit state to
      write upon business, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business!&rdquo; echoed Arthur contemptuously; &ldquo;you're in a fit state to take a
      cab to Mayfair, and ask your poor wife's pardon, I brought her up to her
      aunt's house today myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's well,&rdquo; observed Walter reflectively; &ldquo;for between you and me,
      Arthur Haldane&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; exclaimed the barrister impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think she'd better stay at her aunt's house altogether. The fact
      is, I've got no money to keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know all about that, man&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you do!&rdquo; ejaculated Walter grimly; &ldquo;then bad news must indeed
      fly apace. Look here, Haldane&mdash;I've lost <i>everything</i>. All that
      I have at present; all that I was to have when I came of age; all that I
      can expect from any human being who is fool enough to leave me anything in
      time to come. I am a beggar, and worse than that, for I am a defaulter,
      and shall be proclaimed as such in a few days. That is the whole state of
      the case. <i>Now</i>, do you not think that the kindest office which a
      friend could do me, would be to help me with the means of blowing out,
      what would be in another man, his brains? For not only do I recognise
      myself a scoundrel, but as a senseless dolt and idiot, a fool of the first
      quality, and a&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must owe, then, near seven thousand pounds,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur, with
      something like a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about that, so far as I have dared to look the thing in the face;
      all lost within twenty-four hours&mdash;most of it within three minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must keep this from your mother somehow, Walter. She has been sadly
      tried, and I doubt whether she could bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must know it sooner or later, man, even if she doesn't read it in the
      papers. When your Turf gentry do not get paid, they make a noise about it,
      you see, that being all they can do. I've a precious good mind to take
      myself off to Cariboo&mdash;that's where this fellow Derrick made his
      money&mdash;the climate's good, and with a little capital, one may do a
      good deal. Why should I not go there, and never let them have a penny? The
      law looks upon it as a swindle, <i>you</i> know that well enough; and it
      <i>was</i> a swindle, by Jove! Come, you 're a barrister, Haldane; now,
      what do you say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Walter, I cannot advise you to act in that manner, and I am sure you
      did not propose it seriously yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, certainly not; I was only having a bit of fun,&rdquo; rejoined the other
      bitterly. &ldquo;I am just in the humour for joking now, and can't resist it.
      Thousand devils! would you have me go to the workhouse, man, or where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of that sort is at all necessary, Walter,&rdquo; answered the other
      quietly. &ldquo;Of course, I was not prepared for this very unfortunate position
      of affairs; I had brought news that, through, I must say, the very
      generous behaviour of your elder brother, your income as a married man
      would in future be a very tolerable one; it has been made up to at least
      double what the interest of the sum you have lost would have produced.
      Thus, in addition to your pay, you would have had about six hundred a
      year, besides whatever your wife's aunt might think proper to allow her.
      Your mother, on the other hand, undertakes, if you should scruple to
      accept this kindness at Sir Richard's hands&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scruple? Certainly <i>not</i>,&rdquo; ejaculated Walter angrily. &ldquo;I confess
      that I did not think my brother would have had so much proper feeling, and
      I am much obliged to him, of course; but, after all, he has only done his
      duty. What is three hundred a year out of the Lisgard rent-roll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, he was not obliged to do it,&rdquo; observed Arthur drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; and, of course, you take the lawyer's view of it. Moreover,
      when he comes to hear of these debts, perhaps his Serene Highness may
      think proper to withdraw his gracious assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do him very wrong, Walter,&rdquo; answered Arthur with warmth. &ldquo;Your
      trouble makes you say things you ought to be ashamed of&mdash;yes, ashamed
      of. Your brother, with all his faults, is incapable of committing such an
      act of cruelty. He is quite willing that you should both return to Mirk as
      soon as you please, but particularly that you should be present at his
      Coming of Age, which I am sure you will not fail to be. But if you will
      take my advice, you will not make your position known at Mirk, for, as I
      have said before, your mother has had enough to trouble her. You must let
      your sporting friends understand it, however, and we must make the best
      arrangements we can for your paying your debts within a year; and for the
      future, till something turns up, instead of six hundred per annum, you
      must manage to do on three. Your wife, I am sure, is a most sensible young
      lady, and will easily perceive the necessity for economy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered the dragoon coldly. &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to run
      down to Canterbury, and choose our lodging for us; or do you think we
      ought to be content to live in barracks? I know that there is a great
      temptation to insult a man when he is down; but for giving unpalatable
      advice in an offensive manner, I do not know your equal, Mr Arthur
      Haldane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Walter, I have said what I thought right, and I do not intend to
      quarrel with you. I should wish, on the contrary, to remain your friend,
      if it were only for your dear mother's sake&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And somebody else's,&rdquo; interrupted the captain with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for your sister Letty's, Walter; I frankly own that. Come, give us
      your hand, man.&mdash;Well, another time, then, when you are more like
      yourself.&mdash;But before I go, I want to find this man Derrick, for I
      have a letter for him of importance from Mistress Forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better ask as you go down stairs, Mr Haldane; I know nothing
      about him.&rdquo; And with that, Captain Walter Lisgard deliberately turned his
      back upon his visitor, and looked gloomily out of the window; while his
      white hand stroked his silken moustaches as though it were a pumice-stone,
      and it was his intention to stroke them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur made his inquiry of the servant who opened the hall-door to let him
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Derrick&mdash;if that was the gentleman with the large beard&mdash;had
      come and gone within the last quarter of an hour, while he (Haldane) had
      been talking with the other gentleman up stairs. He had called for his
      bill, and paid it, and packed his portmanteau, and there it was in the
      passage at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must come back for <i>that</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He had left directions that it was to be sent on to him in a week or
      so to some place in the South. He had said that he should be walking, and
      therefore would not be there himself for several days. He had taken a
      knapsack with him as for a regular tour. He was a strange gentleman
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Haldane stooped down, and read the address on the portmanteau&mdash;<i>Mr
      R. Derrick, Coveton</i>; then stepped very thoughtfully into the roaring
      street. &ldquo;I don't know exactly why, and I certainly have no desire to
      know,&rdquo; muttered the young barrister to himself; &ldquo;but of all the bad news I
      have learned to-night, I fear <i>ma mère</i> will consider this the worst.
      Why the deuce should this fellow be going to Coveton, of all places least
      calculated to attract such a scampish vagabond? Coveton, Coveton&mdash;yes,
      that is the place where my Lady came ashore from the wreck of the <i>North
      Star</i>.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE LETTER FROM PARIS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is the morning
      after the Derby Day, and Sir Richard, who has never had a shilling upon
      that national event, yet reads with interest the prose-poem upon the
      subject in the <i>Times</i>, over the breakfast-table, and even favours
      Letty&mdash;which is so unusual a piece of graciousness, that it almost
      suggests the idea of making amends for something&mdash;with extracts from
      the same, aloud. He and his sister are alone at the morning meal, for my
      Lady, as is often the case now, has had her tea and dry toast sent up to
      her in her own room, as also a couple of letters&mdash;one from Arthur
      Haldane, and one with the Paris post-mark, and in a foreign hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Stonart is said to have netted forty thousand pounds: just think of
      that, Letty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Richard; but then think of the poor people that lost it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor people should not bet,&rdquo; returned the baronet severely. &ldquo;I am sorry
      for Mr Chifney, since, if he had not quarrelled with his Lordship, the
      winner would have come out of his stables. As it was, he very nearly
      accomplished it with that French horse <i>Menclaus</i>&mdash;a success
      which I should, as an Englishman, have much deplored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! was not that the horse in which Walter was so much interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don't know, Letty. I should think my brother had no money to
      spare for the race-course, under present circumstances: he could surely
      never be such a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not, Richard. I never said a word about his risking money; I
      only said he was 'interested.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; rejoined the baronet significantly, &ldquo;I dare say;&rdquo; and then he began
      to whistle, as was not unusual with him when thoroughly displeased.
      Presently, however, recollecting that this was not a sociable sort of
      thing to do, Sir Richard abruptly observed: &ldquo;Mamma had a letter from Paris
      this morning, and in a foreign hand; I wonder who her correspondent is. I
      do not think she has heard from abroad since immediately after our poor
      father's death. Then I remember several of her old French friends wrote to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it is no ill news of any kind, for I am getting quite anxious
      about dear mamma, Richard. Ever since Christmas last, she has seemed to
      get more and more depressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only observed it lately,&rdquo; answered the baronet, rather stiffly;
      &ldquo;and I am sure we have not far to look for the reason.&mdash;By the by,
      there was a letter for her from Arthur Haldane also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! was there?&rdquo; said Letty carelessly, but turning a lively pink. Then
      after a short pause, during which the baronet resumed his paper: &ldquo;If you
      will not have another cup of coffee, Richard, I think I will go up and see
      mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, the door opened, and my Lady herself entered the room. Her
      cheeks were ashy pale, but her eyes were beaming with excitement, and the
      hand in which she held an open letter trembled as she spoke. &ldquo;Oh, I have
      got such good news, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! from Arthur?&rdquo; cried Letty. &ldquo;Ah! I thought he would arrange
      everything as it should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard frowned, and seemed about to speak, but did not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard from Arthur too,&rdquo; said my Lady; &ldquo;and very
      satisfactorily, although, perhaps, there may be matters which may require
      my presence in town for a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may always command my services, mother: I can start at five minutes'
      notice,&rdquo; said Sir Richard gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear hoy; if I have to go at all&mdash;which is not certain&mdash;I
      shall certainly go alone, or rather with nobody but Mary. You will be full
      of preparations for your <i>fête</i>, I know, for one only comes of age
      once in one's lifetime; and besides, to tell you the truth, you would be
      of no use at all.&rdquo; Here she kissed him tenderly, and pushed her fingers
      through his brown curls lingeringly, as though she was already wishing him
      farewell. &ldquo;But the good news I speak of is a much more selfish affair than
      you dream of. I have had a letter from my dear old friend, Madame de
      Castellan, who used to be so good to me when I was no older than you,
      Letty, at Dijon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember her,&rdquo; said Sir Richard. &ldquo;She came to stay at the Abbey when I
      was about nine, did she not, and took such a fancy to dear old Belcomb?
      She said that she and I would marry so soon as I got old enough, and set
      up an establishment in the little cottage. A charming old lady, with
      snow-white hair, but a slight deficiency of teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; answered my Lady. &ldquo;She always vowed she would have nothing
      false about her, as long as she lived, and she is alive now, and
      apparently very hearty. But she has had some money losses, as well as
      certain domestic misfortunes, which induce her to seek an entire change of
      life. It is a most singular thing that you should have recollected her
      passion for Belcomb, for it is about that very place that she has written.
      She wishes to know whether she could be our tenant there, at all events
      for the summer. The matter is in your hands, Richard, or will be so in a
      week or two, but I confess I should like to have her for a neighbour
      exceedingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then by all means write and say 'Come,'&rdquo; cried the baronet; &ldquo;and why not
      let her have Belcomb rent free? I dare say she would not mind our having
      our picnics there occasionally; and it is really no loss to me, for I
      don't believe anybody but herself would dream of taking it, except in the
      shooting season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that is arranged,&rdquo; answered my Lady joyfully. &ldquo;I am to write by
      return of post,&rdquo; she says ; &ldquo;and if the letter says 'Yes,' that then we
      may expect her any day. She will bring her own French maid; and I will
      drive over to-day, and arrange about old Rachel and her husband, who, of
      course, must be no losers, if they have to leave. That must be Madame's
      own affair, if she is really to have the place for nothing. See how
      affectionately the dear old lady writes, and what a capital hand,
      considering her advanced age!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Sir Richard, elevating his eyebrows: &ldquo;only, to say the
      truth, I am not good at French manuscript&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although a master of that language, when in printed books,&rdquo; interrupted
      Letty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fact is they didn't teach that sort of thing at Eton in my
      time,&rdquo; answered the baronet frankly; &ldquo;or, at all events, they didn't teach
      <i>me</i>. However, French is not so bad as German, that I will say. One
      <i>can</i> pronounce it without speaking from the pit of one's stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one can&mdash;after a fashion,&rdquo; laughed Letty a little scornfully;
      but her elder brother seemed resolved to take all her bantering in good
      part that morning, as the imperial lion will sometimes tolerate the
      gambols of a companion kitten. &ldquo;I don't think, however,&rdquo; she continued,
      &ldquo;Madame de Castellan, who comes from Paris, will quite understand <i>you</i>,
      Richard.&mdash;How nicely she speaks of Mary, mamma. Why, how comes she to
      know so much about <i>her?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when I went to Dijon, before my marriage, Mary Forest went with me,
      you know, and remained there several years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, of course; I had forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when we were at the&mdash;the college,&rdquo; continued my Lady, with a
      slight tinge of colour, &ldquo;Madame took pity upon us both, being foreigners,
      and was kind to us beyond all measure. Many a happy day have we passed in
      her pretty chateau together; and indeed I think I owe my Parisian
      pronunciation&mdash;of which you seem to make so much, Letty&mdash;at
      least as much to Madame de Castellan as to my paid teachers. She never
      could speak English, if you remember, Richard; everything she addressed to
      you had to be translated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; answered the baronet hastily, &ldquo;I don't like that. I hope she
      has learned English since then. It places one in a very humiliating
      position to be talked to in a language one does not understand; unless you
      can treat the person as a savage, which, to say the truth, I always feel
      inclined to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Richard,&rdquo; said my Lady smiling, &ldquo;if I am not at your elbow when
      Madame de Castellan calls, there will be always Letty here, who is cunning
      in such tongue-fence, to protect you; but, as a matter of fact, we shall
      see my poor old friend but very seldom. She is a good deal broken, I fear,
      by time, and still more by trouble&rdquo;&mdash;here my Lady's own voice began
      to quaver a little&mdash;&ldquo;and all she seems to desire is quiet and
      seclusion, before her day of rest at last shall dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be very welcome,&rdquo; answered Sir Richard tenderly. &ldquo;I hope that
      you will cause everything for her comfort to be looked to at Belcomb, and
      I will again repeat my orders to Rinkel that the place is to be kept quite
      free from trespassers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and kissed his mother, then, as he left the room, delayed with his
      fingers on the door-handle, saying: &ldquo;Have Walter and&mdash;and his wife
      consented to be present at my Coming of Age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear Richard: they will both be very pleased to come&mdash;nay,
      Arthur thinks that they may return to the Abbey immediately. It is
      scarcely worth while for them to take a house, or rather lodgings, at
      Canterbury, since they are to be here so soon. Walter has leave now, it
      seems, and there will be no difficulty in getting it prolonged almost
      indefinitely: he can do anything he likes with his colonel, you know, as
      indeed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; interrupted Sir Richard drily. &ldquo;Then I suppose they will be
      back in a few days.&rdquo; And with that he placed the door between himself and
      the threatened eulogy upon Master Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any particular message for me, mamma?&rdquo; inquired Letty demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Walter? No, dear. He sent his love to us all; but of course he feels
      a little embarrassed, and perhaps scarcely understands that he has been
      forgiven. Oh, I forgot: you meant was there any particular message from
      Arthur Haldane, you exacting little puss! Why, he only left us yesterday
      morning! But don't be vexed, my darling. You have won the love of a man
      who knows your worth almost as well as I do. He may not be so brilliant or
      so handsome as our darling Walter&mdash;and indeed who is?&mdash;but I
      must say he has shewn much better taste in choosing a wife. He has both
      wisdom and goodness, my darling child, and I firmly believe your future
      happiness is assured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearest mother, I do believe it; but&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;Here Letty's eyes
      began not only to sparkle, but to distil pearls and diamonds in the most
      lavish and apparently uncalled-for profusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter now, my love?&rdquo; inquired my Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mamma&mdash;nothing at least that I should have thought it worth
      while to tell you, had I not been overcome by your kind words. I know you
      have got troubles enough of your own; I did not mean to tell you, indeed I
      did not; I tried to forget it myself. Only last night, after you had gone
      to bed, Richard sat up with me talking about his future, and it seems he
      has made some plan for mine. He spoke of Mr Charles Vane as a person he
      would like to have for a brother-in-law. He bade me be particularly civil
      to him at the coming <i>fête</i>; and when I said that I did not very much
      care about Mr Vane&mdash;and, in fact, that I had already&mdash;&mdash; O
      mamma, Richard said some very cruel things. He reminded me that one member
      of the family had already made a disreputable marriage&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an ungenerous speech, and very unlike my Richard,&rdquo; interposed my
      Lady with emphasis. &ldquo;Why, he would have married Rose himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have sometimes thought,&rdquo; replied Letty simply: &ldquo;but to do him
      justice, I think he was referring to the clandestine character of the
      marriage rather than to the match itself. However, when he used the word
      disreputable in connection with Arthur Haldane, he made me very angry, I
      own. I told him that Arthur was worth all the Vanes that had ever been
      born, whether there might have been nineteen generations of them (as he
      boasted) or a hundred and ninety. And I am afraid, dear mamma, that I
      snapped my fingers, and said I did not care <i>that</i>, when he accused
      dearest Arthur of not having a great-grandfather. At all events, Richard
      stalked out of the drawing-room vastly offended; and although he has been
      endeavouring to be extra civil to me this morning, I know that it is only
      that he may again introduce the very objectionable subject of Mr Charles
      Vane; and when I say 'No' with decision, as of course I shall do, I fear
      that he may take it upon himself to write to Arthur; and then, dearest
      mother, the Haldanes are so proud, you know, that I don't know what may
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange as it may seem, there had flitted across my Lady's face during
      this recital a look of something like Relief&mdash;for it surely could not
      have been Satisfaction&mdash;but it speedily gave place to that expression
      of distress that had become only too habitual to her once serene and
      comely features. Perhaps, accustomed to mischance as she now was, she had
      expected even more unwelcome news, and had felt momentarily thankful
      matters were no worse; but now all was gloom again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right to tell me this, Letty, even though it does give me
      a new cause for grief. If I know Arthur Haldane, he will not desert his
      betrothed wife on account of any slight that may be put upon him by any
      other human being. You may be quite at ease about that, I am very sure.
      But these dissensions and disagreements among my own children&mdash;I know
      it is not your fault, dear Letty&mdash;but I feel that I cannot bear up
      under them. You will not have me with you here much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mamma&mdash;dear, dear mamma, how selfish it was of me thus to afflict
      you further. But don't, don't talk like that. What should we do without
      you&mdash;you the sole bond that unites your boys together: and <i>I</i>?
      O mother, what would become of <i>me?</i> You don't know how I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling, I do. You are tenderhearted as you are dutiful. And my
      boys, to do them justice, they love me too; but they are wearing me into
      my grave. At least, I feel it would be far better if I were lying there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mamma, mamma,&rdquo; sighed Letty, covering my Lady's tearful face with
      kisses, &ldquo;you will break my heart if you talk so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have somebody better able to-take care of you even than I, dear
      child, when I am gone. And I will see that it is so. Yes, I will leave
      directions behind me&mdash;you will find them in my desk, Letty; remember
      this, should anything happen to me&mdash;about that matter as well as
      other things. Richard will respect my wishes in such a case, I know, and
      will offer no opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dearest mother, do you feel ill,&rdquo; cried Letty in an agony, &ldquo;that you
      talk of such things as these? Let us send for the doctor from Dalwynch.
      How I wish that Arthur's father could be prevailed on to come and see you!
      O mamma! I would rather die than you, although I am sure I am not half so
      fit for death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child, dear child!&rdquo; sobbed my Lady. &ldquo;It will be a bitter parting
      indeed for both of us&mdash;when the time comes. Perhaps it may not be so
      near at hand as I feared. In the meantime, rest assured, love, that if I
      feel a doctor can do me any good, he shall be sent for at once. But it is
      the mind, and not the body, which has need of medicine.&mdash;There, dry
      your eyes, and let us hope for the best. You will drive over with me this
      afternoon, will you not, to Belcomb? There is no time to lose in getting
      things ready there for our new tenant.&rdquo;
